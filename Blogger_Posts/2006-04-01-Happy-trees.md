I only have one thing to say about this, really.  Heck Yes.






Bob Ross painting on the Revolution?!






Courtesy of Revolution Fanboy, the site indicates there is "a press release on the official Bob Ross (R.I.P.) website stating a game based on Bob Ross' teachings is to hit the Revolution."






Further, the game will "utilize the unique inputs that the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Revolution have that can truly immerse the players while they learn to paint like Bob Ross and can play the addictive and fun games that we have planned for the title. "






In all likelihood, this article must have something to do with today's date. 






Think Happy Trees.
