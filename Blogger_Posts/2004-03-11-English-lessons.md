# English lessons

English lessons.  As a rule of thumb, you should never try and persuade rules of writing without proper research.  My wife taught me this important lesson earlier tonight.  It turns out that I may know something about writing, but I have a difficult time expressing where I learned it from. 






It all started when I asked her to make sure and proof this Blog for me, as she is usually the first to read it.  She told me she would, and already had something in mind.  She pointed out a good one.  Yesterday, I quoted Kobe Bryant as saying "just not right."  For good reason, she told me to take the period out of the quotes and end the sentence on the outside of the statement. 






But sometime ago, I learned that commas and periods remain inside of the statement at the end of a sentence, and exclamation points and question marks are placed on the outside.  She proceeded to take out her Psychology book to show me several examples of period usage outside of the quotes.






Unsurprisingly, I became flustered because I felt that years of habit were crumbling before me.  Not willing to give up, I googled the phrase, "quotation mark and period usage" and found the following page.  I wouldn't necessarily declare victory, as success is generally derived from hardened dedication.  I'd give the victory straight to her, as her quiet patience taught me a lesson, as always.  What a girl.






Star Trek II.  After the results of the previous Star Trek viewing, I had cast off all thought of my wife agreeing to watch any further installments of this series.  But we did end up watching the second film tonight, and it made me remember that this one was probably my favorite.  The story of Khan is excellent, and there was enough plausible drama to keep us both entertained for the entire movie.  Gone were the long segments of elaborate homecoming; instead, the entirety was driven by the storyline.  But I'll pass on the full review for tonight.  I'm much too tired for that.






Baby shower tomorrow.  It's hard to believe that we've come this far already, the preparations seemed so far off for this event.  I've distanced myself pretty well from the occasion, partly out of jealously, mainly out of frustration.  But I'm sure that the wife will have a great time, and she sure deserves all the neat things she'll undoubtedly get.  I'll be sure to list a few of the more memorable items tomorrow, as the week is retiring quickly and I'm running out of material. 


Until then, keep the fire hot.  We'll see you again.
