# Happy Friday
Date: March 01, 2002

Greetings and happy Friday.






This weekend, I will be moving the site to a new host, so you may experience some problems when attempting to view it. This should all be taken care of by Sunday night, and i will email everyone the new address. What's to come? All of my previous writings will be published to the site, so that anyone who is curious may see them. Also, a great little piece of web genius called Difference of Opinion, which is the creation of my friend Eric and his friend Mike. So, be on the lookout for both of those.






Also to come: Curiosities of TV in the desert, Painting the house of Webb, and much more. Stay tuned, for sure.






Enjoy the weekend!
