# Manhole covers
Date: January 23, 2002

Surely I can think of something to write.....






Today I got to go out on the job site to look at manhole covers. Yep, beautiful, beautiful manhole covers...It was quite the experience, really. I learned that every step you take is about 3 feet long, and therefore I had to dust off the old brain and divide foot measurements by 3's. That was a tough one, but what made it worse was that I had to walk while I was dividing. I actually had to stop once, pause, divide 3 into some insanely easy number like 140 and then keep walking. For some reason, the number "7" wouldn't leave my mind. Uh huh, three must go into 140 seven times. Math is just not my gig. But honestly, you'd think that I could divide, for cryin' out loud...






But thank goodness I still have basketball. It's one of those rare beauties I have in life that makes me feel great afterward. Even when I lose, I still feel like I knew what I was doing.* Tonight I also asked this girl in my institute class on a date. Now, all I need is ideas. No more bagel dates. There can be only one of those, I'm 'fraid. Oh, and I'm sure that Adam Dawson will appreciate this one: Sleep America...where America goes TO sleep". Not FOR sleep. You were correct, much to my dismay. For a confirmation of this...please visit their website.






Inside stories. Maybe I shouldn't write them on here...nah.






*Sshhh, Kevin, quiet, Neal... Your time will undoubtedly come.....
