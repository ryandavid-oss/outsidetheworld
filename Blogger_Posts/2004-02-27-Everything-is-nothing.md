# Everything is nothing
Date: February 27, 2004

Everyone should learn at least one lesson per day, if not more.  The lesson for me yesterday was this: never try to learn PHP and implement it into your Web site 30 minutes before you go to bed.  If you do, you'll end up with a defunct link and empty promises.






Best Buy.  I visited my very favorite store again tonight, Thursdays are very rewarding days because I can take the car wherever I please.  I wandered over toward the video games section to check out the new James Bond game.  It's supposed to be different because not only does it use the real actor's names, it uses their voices and personage.






The title of this new game is "Everything Or Nothing".  Yeah, that's good, and I suppose that it'll suit the game just nicely.  But aren't the titles of Bond movies supposed to be a little more self-defeating?  Why not, "Everything Is Nothing".  




Yes, that sounds much better.  Ten times more obscurity in that sentence. 






That's it for now.  I have mind-numbing fatigue washing over me.  See you again tomorrow.
