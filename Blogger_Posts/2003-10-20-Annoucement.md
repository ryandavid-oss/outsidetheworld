# Annoucement
Date: October 20, 2003

This week: Announcement, air conditioning, and recovery.






Brought back to the site by necessity, really.






Whenever I find out that anybody still checks this site, I feel a pang of guilt. Whenever they ask me to update it, for crying out loud, I feel a call of responsibility.






Also, I promised my wife that I would write more often. How about we start this week off with my news:

There (he/she) is. In that blurry little picture, you will find my fetura. Jenna and I are fully convinced that little critter is a boy, however we could still be surprised. We both would love a little girl, Jenna says that I only say that so that I can have a little daddy's girl. I have yet to argue that point.






Nevertheless, if this creation turns out male, you will not find any happier parents than we.






Other news: Our air conditioner broke, and it has not been the best weekend because of that. The remarkable thing is that it would matter normally, we're nearing the very conclusion of October. Why, it should be 80 degrees.






Nah, it's still in the lower 100's. Our Weather.






No matter, we don't need it right now. But the cat loves the tile right now. A lot.
