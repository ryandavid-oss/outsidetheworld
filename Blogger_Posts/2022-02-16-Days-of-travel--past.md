About a year ago, it seemed I was traveling to California every other weekend to see my wife (née fiancé), whether by car or plane.  But my gosh, was air travel ever preferable.  I am reminded that in California, public restrooms have been considered a massive luxury since the pandemic started, so it made the electric driving miles tantamount to medieval torture as I stopped for 20-30 minutes every 200 miles.
