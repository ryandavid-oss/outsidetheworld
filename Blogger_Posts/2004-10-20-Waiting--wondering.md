# Waiting, wondering
Date: October 20, 2004

We're waiting for Sumner to fall asleep.  I'm glad that I learned the lesson of ritualistic living,  otherwise I may have lapsed into a coma long ago.  Besides, one can come up with enough variety to spice up life if they try hard enough.






For a third day in a row, I've been allowed to leave early from work.  While this does not afford me a full day's pay, it has been enjoyable to taste the "early release" again.  To those still in grade school, cherish those days forever.  Go get a slice of pizza instead of going home and watching television.  I dunno.  Fly a kite or something.






In the next room, I can vaguely hear my son moaning wearily.  He's so tired that he cannot fight it any longer.  But still he must make some amount of noise.  I'm willing to wager that he's asleep by the end of this blog.  Man, that really does sound sad.  But at least it's not a full cry...yet.






Other things worthy of mention:  We moved out of our old abode into a new apartment.  We did it completely sight unseen.  As we figured it, anything was better than the place we had dwelled previously.  The simple joy of not hearing 56 motorcycles on their way home from mechanic school at 11:30 at night is unspeakably poignant.  To no longer have a street sign lighting up your room is equally wonderful. 






There.  I believe that Sumner has drifted away into slumber ok maybe not.  Just like that a sleeping baby becomes awakened by the slightest noise...in this case, perhaps a leaf fell to the ground outside.  That must measure as a 7.8 on a baby's auditory Richter scale.  Perhaps it was nothing more than a passing thought that kept him awake. 






But without language, what are his thoughts like?  Images, probably.  Colors, sounds, and memories of the day.  Much like his daddy's dreams, except much less filled with thoughts of money and basketball.  Those don't go hand in hand except when trying to come up with something interesting to write about.






I've also reenrolled in school, and am about half-way done with the semester.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be; however, taking abstract classes such as Psychology and Sociology is a disaster.  Those classes are especially dangerous to take online if it is your first venture into the online setting.  Online classes often leave you with but one recourse...that of reading the entire text book and hopefully gleaning the correct material for your quizzes and tests.   I think it premature to say that I despise online classes, and even would admit that there will be many more to come.  But I long for a regular classroom.  One where discussion and questioning of material is second-hand.






Sumner is quiet now.  Time for his daddy to find a peaceful time of things.  Goodnight.
