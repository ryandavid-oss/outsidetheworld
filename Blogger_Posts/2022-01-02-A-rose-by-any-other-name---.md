What a ride.  This season was absolutely bonkers from start to finish.  Losing to BYU was the worst blow, maybe even worse than tonight's narrow loss to Ohio State.  
You have to hand it to OSU for their ability to make adjustments after halftime.  I was never quite comfortable with our lead, even when we seemed firmly in control.  But in retrospect...were we ever in control?  It seemed like the nerves kept us in check.  Even when our specialties shown through, we weren't able to get off our heels.  
It sure would have been nice to ring in the new year with a Rose Bowl victory to cap this otherwise outstanding season.  
Next season, boys.  Next season.
