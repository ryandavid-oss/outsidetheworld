# Cat in the Hat
Date: November 24, 2003

My apologies!  Welcome to the "lunch time" edition of the Blog.  Special note:  You will find no great entertainment here today.



I simply knew that I needed to write today.  There isn't anything in specific that needs to be written, but this is simply just in case there are any of those out there that check this blog after the weekend is over.



Wife and I saw the Cat in the Hat movie this weekend, or should I say, the Crap in the Sack movie.  Big pile of flaming Crap in the Sack.  It was terrible.  That's the only way to describe it, really...it was terrible.  Every time the Cat (aka Mike Myers) opened his mouth, my mind was sent into reparatory prayer.  Please, please make him stop talking.  Please....



And so on.  Sure, there were a few funny moments, but I can drivel out a few laughs of my own on this blog.  And they don't cost a dime!



Free laughs!  Now at the Blog!



Anyway, that was the weekend summed up in one bad movie.  Only one other thing of note, last night I had the strangest dream.



There were two ingredients to this dream:  A dog and a crab.



Cross these two items together and you get a very disturbing hairy sea creature.  In my dream, I went to my friends house to talk to them.  Out of the corner of my eye, I spied a strange looking object.



"Oh, never mind that.  That's just my dog", said my friend.



So I walked over to it, naturally, and found the greatest offense against nature.  It had the body of a dog, the claws of a crab, and it was sunk low to the ground with little crab feet.  And it was hairy.



Well, don't know where I'm going with that.  Now, time to call the wife.  See you on Tuesday!
