# 03/24/2009 - Welcome to the new blog, plus a chance to win!
Date: March 24, 2009

Hello, what's this?  A new blog?

I had a heck of a time getting this new site ready for launch.  I thought that it'd be nice and easy...install a new blogging software on my Web site, take the main page down for a while, and voila...but no!  I had 42 headaches to contend with.  But now I can take a deep breath, relax, and begin posting the daily rants and ramblings of my mind.  And I hope you'll find some entertainment value in reading what I have to say.

Because if you're new here, you may notice that I've been writing posts for a while.  Seven years, to be exact.  Well before such publishing tools like Blogger, Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter became insanely popular, I was trying my hardest to get content online.  I've met some success throughout the years, but have been reduced to smithereens over and over again because of my uncanny ability to wax lazily into oblivion.  Why do I feel like this time will be any different?  I suppose I never said that.  I'm just crossing my fingers this time!

So, to those of you who haven't stopped by here before, welcome.  What do I do with this site?  The blog page, which you find yourself at currently, is the main portion of the site.  This is where I spend the most time pruning and cultivating the inner workings of my mind.  I try hard to stay relevant, sticking to topics that matter to people that read my work.  Religion, politics, and similar subjects are not necessarily taboo, but rarely discussed here.  But again, trying to stay relevant, they may pop up more as time goes along.  And I must admit, long blocks of text aren't my thing.  Normally, there will be pictures to go along with whatever story I have here. 

Other sections of the site include the Moblah'g, which is powered solely by my iPhone.  There's rarely anything said here of real substance; but there you'll find some of the best personal pictures around.  There's just something about having a camera that can post anything your eye sees, whenever the mood strikes you. 

You'll also find examples of photography, but I must warn you...this is not my strong area.  In recent years, I've noticed the literal explosion of Web sites dedicated to close friends who have discovered the flair for digital photography.  Many of my friends and acquaintances are exceptional at their art, and they nobly make it known with remarkable finesse.  I make no such statement with my photography.  Indeed, as is mentioned on the front page of Outsidetheworld, these pictures are simply what I saw when I was lucky enough to have a camera by my side.  Hopefully I'll get a bit better with time.

Geez.  I've spent way too much time in front of the computer today.  Time to go play some basketball.  Sorry for the heavy tone of this entry!  I promise to be much more candid in the weeks to come.  This really doesn't even sound like me.  I suppose I'm trying to put my best foot forward, as I only have this chance to make a good impression.  See you next time!
