Not much to say, I'm afraid.  Been a busy few weeks since the wife and I returned from Disneyland.  Mirroring my latest post to Instagram, this was a shot I took near my place of work during a walk around the block.  
The hotel property in which these palms belong is being renovated to become some sort of long-term housing. Not sure how well that'll go over.  The place might be haunted.  It's a long story.
Thanks for visiting, as always.
