# Sick
Date: January 25, 2002

So, I woke up sick this morning...






I hate that feeling that you get when you first wake up. You know the one I'm talking about, when your chest feels like your bed decided to lay on you halfway through the night? Yeah, that one. I have this interminable cough that just won't leave me alone. Sure, it takes vacations every once in a while, but apparently it got tired of wherever it was the past few weeks and is here to curse my life again. So I ended up not going into work today, which in and of itself isn't bad, but tomorrow I know I'll wake up feeling even worse, and then I won't want to call in sick because then I look like a pansy. You should never ever call in sick the first day you feel bad. I think it should be a rule.






Well, our ward did play our first basketball game tonight, and we won 64-44. Twas an excellent game. I think one poor old guy ruptured his Achilles tendon right when the game started though. The first rule when you are 50 years old and trying to play with kids half your age has been and always will be: Stretch. So anyway.






Krystal ....this is your paragraph, Your very own paragraph on my little silly-site. Now, don't go saying I don't care about you. And to all the rest of my friends in Provo, Marci, Cat, Britney, Sarah, Janelle, John, you must be included in Krystal's paragraph too. I hope all is well in BYU town.






Carpe Diem.
