Fine.  Reap your rewards.  
Thankfully, we made it back in one piece.  And it looked like the lion's share of our adjacent travelers did, as well.  Those who slid off the road were, at best, mildly inconvenienced.  For the worst, they might have had to catch a ride back into town.  We did see one poor fellow who careened off the 17 and tore his entire bumper off.  
Glad to be back in the Valley of the Sun.
