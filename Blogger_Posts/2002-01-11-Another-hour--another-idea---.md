Another hour, another idea...



Well, not exactly. I stole this from my elder brother adam. In fact, most of what I'm doing now is just a rip-off of his great ideas. Here is a link for where you can look at any pictures that I post. Just click on "pictures" on the left of the screen, and you should get there. Note: There are no pictures yet. Muah hah. It's an MSN community, slow as all get-out, but it's free and Americans like them freethings.



Oh, I'm an american.

I thought you knew that.

You did?

oh.
