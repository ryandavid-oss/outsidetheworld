# Secret song
Date: March 17, 2004

Not too much to say today, I'm afraid.  I went to bed relatively early last night, so no entry was written.  I can definitely say that's a good thing, because anything written last night would have been poor, poor material.  No promises for today, though.






As it's St. Patrick's Day, I've decorated the Blog site and have worn a green shirt.  That's the extent of my celebration.  When I was younger, my father would put green food coloring in the milk and pancake batter for breakfast.  I seem to remember that my mom was never a big fan of that...but who would be a fan of green milk?  Nobody but an eight year old kid, that's who.






Did you know that the Cheat was hatched from a fish-stick filled egg?  Does that mean that The Cheat is classified in the same family as say, the Platypuses and echidnas?  Excepting of course that none of their eggs are crammed full of fish sticks.  Perhaps one day soon, we'll be introduced to a little more background on this small yellow mystery...






A good friend of mine paid visit last night.  It's that time of year for spring break visits, and it's always nice to have old friends stop by.  There wasn't too much time for fooling around, we went to the nearby 7 Eleven store to pick up some Slurpees and then took off for his house.  (Side note:  Slurpees are great.)






During the car ride to his house, we listened to Strong Bad's CD.  I confess right now, when he asked me if I had listened to it, I said yes. However, I had not.  Why did I lie?  Because it seemed that I ought to have listened to it, this friend and I used to experience these types of things in tandem.  So, by admitting that I hadn't yet heard it was confessing that I wasn't up with it...I would be declaring my separation from all things singular.  Well, as this friend reads my entries oft, he now knows the truth.






But, we both were able to sing our silly heads off on the way, and it made me realize how good it is to let your guard down every so often.  It takes a special kind of guy to allow you to sing, "The Cheat is NOT DEAD" in front of them. 






It's work time, so this entry has to be cut short.  But, as a special treat today, I give you the lyrics to the "Secretest Song" on the Strong Bad CD! 






As sung by Homestarrunner:






Secret song!

I can’t believe it’s you!

I never knew it was true…

Oh secret song!



Secret song, soooooooooong!!

You’re the secretest song on the album, secret song.

Songs are made of mysteries.

And clouds of made of moon beams, secret song.



Secret song…

I love you…All night long.



I can’t stand to see you go.



Secret song…I love you so.



Wait….good enough.
