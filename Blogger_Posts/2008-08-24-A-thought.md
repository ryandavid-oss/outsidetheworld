# A thought
Date: August 24, 2008

I am out of practice, it seems. I used to find such relief in this web
site, and though the core of that feeling still surfaces from time to
time, I can't help bit notice the lack of passion in my writing.Every sign in nature tells me that it's partly a temporary phase in
life. The other part of the puzzle eludes classification for the time
being. I want to begin writing again. And not just more often, but
full-time. I want nothing more than to find a way to earn a little
scratch from this site someday soon.My job drives me crazy, in other words. It's the underlying current in
most of the thoughts of my life right now. I'm not miserable anymore,
for what that's worth. But I just don't derive the same satisfaction
or otherwise from my pursuits in the office. It all feels incredibly
empty and callous. Then again, I do realize I'm looking for meaning in
something that most people just do out of social obligation and
shouldn't really take it all to heart. Maybe. Maybe not!My arms are getting tires, as the baby is asleep on my chest right now
and I'm typing upside down with my arms extended above me. Excuse the
length. More to come later!RD BurninghamSent from my iPhone
