# Back in time
Date: June 05, 2008

I just spent a few moments looking back at old posts I made with my  
Treo. I was quite against the ol' iPhone once upon a time, wasnt I?All in all, I'd say the iPhone is a better device, by about 600%.  I'm  
anxious for Monday morning, when the new iPhone will supposedly be  
announced.I already told my dad that i would be buying it, post haste. He just  
rolled his eyes and smiled. He knows me all too well.RD BurninghamSent from my iPhone
