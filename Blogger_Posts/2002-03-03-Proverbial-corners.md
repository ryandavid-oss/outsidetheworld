# Proverbial corners
Date: March 03, 2002

I think i've finally turned the corner with the site now.

 


It's about 1:30 in the morning, i'm still awake, i have no idea why, but i wanted to post a blog after my successul revamp of Outsidetheworld.com. Already this weekend has flown by, i'll try my hardest to make Sunday last as long as possible. Earlier today, (Saturday) i helped paint my co-workers house. It wasn't a big deal, kind of fun really, but the wind was tenacious and didn't give us a moment's rest. Paint was flying everywhere, and it seemed to try its hardest to blow me off the ladder whenever i was in a precarious position.

 


The rest of the day was spent glued to my computer screen, trying to figure out just how to use Microsoft Frontpage. Go figure.

 




May your weekend last longer than mine!
