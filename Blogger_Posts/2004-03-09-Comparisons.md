As it's still my birthday, I'll make this a brief entry.   The wife and I ran all around town today, having all sorts of fun, and now we're ready to collapse for a few hours.  But I won't leave you all empty handed, oh no. 






What I have for you today is a video.  To clarify, a video of a chicken.  Yes yes, I know.  I beat things to death.  But I figure that when you have a theme, you ought to go with it.  It seems that the chicken was still around when we got home last night, even though promises were made for its safe retrieval.  For all I know, the poor guy is still cluckin' about outside, wondering how he got to be in this predicament.  He seemed to be quite worried when I approached him, to tell the truth. 






So what was the prize for today?  The ultimate gift had to be the Star Trek box set.  That completes the collection at ten DVDs.  That's pretty happy news.  We sat down last night to watch the first one.  My wife had of course never seen the earlier Treks, and it had been quite a few years since I had viewed it, save maybe the last few minutes on some cable channel.  The only word I have to describe that first installment is odd.  Such a strange, odd show.  I like it, but there is just so much pomp and non-climatic chorus. 






As I explained (or tried) to my wife, this movie arrived years after the final episode of the television series, so they intended the seven minute sequence of Kirk and Scotty soaring around the new Enterprise to be somewhat of a touching moment.  But now, watching the movie in 2004, it all feels a bit hokey, like they're making too much of a deal about the reunion and such.   You want to push the fast forward button to the action parts, but the movie is meant to be cerebral and platonic.  Needless today, we're moving right along to the latter movies with greater anticipation.






So that's it.  The birthday is at an end, and by what I hear outside of my office window, the neighbors have reported that the chicken has taken roost just beyond their front porch.  That's fine, as he had previously staked out the seat of my scooter as his new home.  He decided against it. 






Perhaps he found it too familiar.....
