# It's 5:25am..what the heck
Date: August 28, 2007

So, we got into town here in Lehi, Utah at around 3:30am...but add another hour because of daylight savings time, and you have a much less inviting hour to start sleeping.  Plus, I had my very first "energy drink" tonight.  Since I had so much driving to do, I figured it'd be the right thing to do.The can says 50% juice.  Ok, that's believable, but I think the remaining 50% is deer urine.  The stuff tastes terrible, and it only gets worse as it gets warmer. But that particular drink was a "Rockstar" beverage.  The first can I tried was a "Monster", and that tasted like a bag of skittles blended in a can of grape Shasta with 14 sugar packets for good measure.  The thing was so sweet, it made my head spin.  I do believe we could have poured it into our gas tank and gone an extra 300 miles or so.So, the point is that I guess I prefer the taste of orange deer urine, because I finished that can, but only managed about a fifth of the Monster.  Go figure.I should try to get some sleep.  It's gonna be a long day, and the rest of the family is sleeping soundly.  But how can I sleep when I have the remnants of the Soul Shaker 5000 coursing through my veins?  Off I go to try!  Goodnight!  Or good morning.  Either way.
