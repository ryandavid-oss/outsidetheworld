# Santa's Pipe
Date: December 12, 2003

Finally, Friday is upon us.   It's unique signature is visible upon the week's horizon.



This week, I have provided you with a different snapshot every day.  Well, I don't have a new one today.  I just couldn't muster it.  So instead, I have delved into my treasure chest of old pictures to give you this:

I got this a couple of years ago from my elder brother.  He usually had this threatening picture of Saint Nick up on his refrigerator door, and he had some sort of clever caption, written by himself, affixed somewhere nearby.



Oh yes, I believe it went something like, "Only good little girls and boys get to know what's in Santa's pipe".



Well, it's paraphrased, anyway.  I'm sure my brother will write me tomorrow and let me know what it really said.  And now, it's made its way on the the old Net.  What do you think about that, eh?



Well, this week was my gift to you.  And now, it's at an end.  Sorry about the short entry today. It's been a long day, after all.  Have a great weekend, and I'll see you back here on Monday. (or Sunday night, for all you blogjumpers out there)
