I'm sitting here with Sumner at the same McDonalds that I would visit  

when I was his age. It looks largely the same in the dining area,  

though I am disappointed that the play area has been robbed of Mayor  

McCheese, Grimace, and the Hamburgler. It's also moved indoors, though  

that's understandable with the climate.



Sumner really doesn't believe me that I used to live here when I was  

his age. I'll keep trying to convince him today.
