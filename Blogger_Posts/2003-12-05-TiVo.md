# TiVo
Date: December 05, 2003

A little late in the day, but still, it's December 5th.



And since this is probably going to be archived fairly soon, I'd imagine that this particular entry won't be widely read by everyone.  So, I suppose that I can write whatever I want, and no one will care!



It was a busy week.  Five days, completely non-stop.  From work, to fixing my friend's computers, I don't remember one moment when I wasn't doing something, somewhere.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow with great anticipation, as I have absolutely nothing on the agenda.



Ah, time to spare.  Maybe a little bit of it will be spent on the Web site, maybe a little on catching up on a little TiVo'd television, probably a little shopping, and a whole lotta nothin'.



I hope that the weekend greets all of you in the same regard.



If any of you haven't noticed, there's a new page link on this site.  It's called Flotsam, and it's where everything that I've already retired is going to wash up.  From old graphics to old outdated Web pages, you'll find it in there.  For those who have visited this site frequently, you may recognize a few pictures.  Warning:  Most of the links in those pages are very, very defunct.  You'll soon meet Mr. 404 if you wade around those pages for very long.



In other news:  My Wife's second ultrasound is next Tuesday.  Mark your calendars, because there will be quite an entry that day.



Have a great weekend!  May yours last as long as mine.
