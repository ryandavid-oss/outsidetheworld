A small story to end yer day...



I was sent on an errand at work today at about 4:00 pm. My task was to drive to Tempe and drop off a set of plans. Simple enough, but once i entered the freeway, my fun was over. Little did i know but i was about 10 miles from running out of gas, and i ran into some nasty traffic just outside Dunlap Avenue. "Golly", i think to myself as i putter along at about 1.3 miles per hour, praying to the gasoline gods and everything efficient and holy that my car doesn't die and i become ridiculed by every well fueled Phoenician on his or her way home from work. Prayers were answered, and i was able to make it to a "QT" gas station. I don't know what "QT" stands for, i don't want to know, all i know is the gas flowed and i was able to return to my errand as planned...



Upon arrival at the destination in Tempe, i decided to lounge around a bit. I wandered about inside the red-stoned building where i dropped my goods off and found that it smelled somewhat, but not entirely like the MTC. Random, i know, but it did. When i got to my car (or money pit, as i refer to him now) I listened to NPR for a little while and learnt about a type of music called "Minimalism". The basic idea of minimalism is to take a few chords and play them over and over again, but at different tempos and rhythms. Sounds dull and trance-like, but it's amazing to me. I listened to several pieces, was incredibly pleased by the simple yet obviously complex patterns that emerged, and promptly turned the station to 104.7 to listen to "today's hottest hits". I was less than impressed.



Oh well. Life is fun. Thanks for reading...
