# Brand New Day
Date: August 02, 2011

Just thinking back to the year 2000; things seemed to be happening and disappearing at the same stroke of the master's brush.  I leaned heavily on music to create a mood around me.  Moving from the 1900's to 2000's seemed so momentous back then.  In Sting's words, regarding the song Brand New Day:




"I wanted to write an optimistic song about love that began in one place and ended up in another... I used the symbol of Y2K as a symbol of beginning again. Turn the clock to zero is an interesting symbol. A symbol of rebirth." 




I'm wondering; ought I to pine for a time far gone?  Can rebirth occur at any time?
