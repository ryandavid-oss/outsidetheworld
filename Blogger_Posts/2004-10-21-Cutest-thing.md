# Cutest thing
Date: October 21, 2004

The Jazz got whooped tonight.  I don't recall the score exactly, but it was like 670-36.  We went to the game tonight with a couple of our friends, so gratefully that made it worth it. 






Not a whole lot else on my mind, I'm afraid.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I keep typing lines and deleting them.  Must be a sign. 






I will, however, leave you with this:

I don't care what he's doing.  He's the cutest thing on the planet.
