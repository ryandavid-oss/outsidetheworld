# Marital peer-pressure
Date: March 07, 2006

I'm back.  Interestingly enough, I'm listening to a lecture for a class that I just got home from.  No need to bore you with specifics.  However I find it interesting because I never thought I'd be listening to the class again after having sat there for two and a half hours.






I wish I had more interesting news to report; I really do.  I'm most happy that I am actually accomplishing something with the Web site.  I forgot how much I really enjoyed writing complete drivel on this site.






The rebuild of the site should also be done fairly soon.  I am completely removing all traces of the "professional" side of OTW.  It finally occurred to me, after many years of doing this, that I don't truly enjoy building Web sites for other people.  I don't find the same happiness when I complete anything else other than a new page for OTW.  Sure, I've done it; and I'd do it again for any friend that asks.  But the reality of it is that OTW deserves to be a simple site, one where navigation is a breeze and information (meaningless or not) comes naturally.






So tomorrow is my 27th birthday, which means...I'm turning 27.  I can remember as a smile child when older friends and family would tell me that birthdays just didn't mean that much as they got older.  I felt sad at that thought.  But it's all natural; it's just the way life is.  You turn your thoughts and energies to those who you care about most and that becomes your joy.  Now, that's not to say that I am not looking forward to tomorrow.  I have much to look forward to, such as a gathering of family and a present or two from my wife.  On top of that, my wonderful boss granted me the day off.  I don't believe I have ever worked on my birthday, and I don't intend to start.  Kind of keeps the magic alive, right?  I mean, I don't have a Hot Wheels racing track or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figure to open up tomorrow.  Yeah, I loved my Turtles.






Anyone who happens upon this site might also wish to take a gander at Bloggenpucky and Code Sanctuary.  There seems to be a general rebirth of blogging among my closest friends and family, and for that I am grateful. 






And speaking of which, my beautiful wife just sent me a message.






It appears that her Web site has been updated.






Is there such a thing as peer pressure within a marriage? (see post from yesterday)






Love ya, Jenna.
