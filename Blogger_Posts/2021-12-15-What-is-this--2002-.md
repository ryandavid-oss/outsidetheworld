# What is this, 2002?
Date: December 15, 2021

It's been a while.  A fairly long decade, in fact.
Which brings to me to what makes starting again so difficult...there's simply no conceivable way to summarize what's happened over the past 3,650 days.  What's more, I haven't much of a penchant for reliving the past whether in deed or, in this project's objective, word.  
So we'll start fresh, right here, right now.  Keeping it simple with the same domain I've had since the year 2000.  Dumped all of the old blog posts (all 415 of them) into the archive, and maybe...just maybe...some of them will resurface in the coming weeks, months, and years.
Suffice it to say that I am grateful for new starts, creative energies, and noise cancelling headphones.  And not necessarily in that order.
