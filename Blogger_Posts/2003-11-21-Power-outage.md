# Power outage
Date: November 21, 2003

Sorry about yesterday...



I was preparing to write last nights' entry, when all of a sudden, *poof* the power went out.  It was an incredibly eerie feeling; we've never seen it that dark at our apartment.  Even when all of our lights were out, we always had the lamps outside shining through our windows.



As the lights went dark, several hoots and hollers were heard from the adjacent apartment buildings.  I looked outside, alarmed.  "Oh, it's just the neighbor boys!", I said.



I now know that a power failure must be an invitation for young men to begin acting like loons.



At least 10 of them ended up jumping in the neighboring pool.  When they realized that, "Hey, it's just a power outage, and we're cold", they finally shut up and got out.



So the rest of the evening was spent in stillness and candlelight.  Wife and I played cards, well, we played "Go Fish" to be specific.  Go Fish is now Wife's favorite game to play with me.  Did I mention that she's never won?  But it's her favorite game.



Oh yeah.  Dobby completely wrecked our Christmas tree two nights ago.  He decided that it was his new play thing, so he climbed through and through.



What was left was not pretty.



So, he's on my bad list at the moment.  And he knows it, too.  He sulks around the house, occasionally glancing up at me, begging to see a glimmer of recognition that he's a good kitty.   But every time, I give him the look that makes him understand that he's in the dog house.  Pardon my language.



And such is life for us.  I hope that you've enjoyed tonight's entry.  But now, I must ask a favor of you.  If anyone knows of a good software program that will let me create my own MP3 songs, please let me know.  (Make sure that it's under $100.00)



Ah, a good excuse for you to Contact me.
