"Hmm, what's this?  A strange attachment from someone that I don't know?"






"Yes", said my conscience. "Be careful."






"I'd better scan it for viruses, just to be safe."






"Um, ok.  Or you could delete it"






"No, it could be important.  I'll just scan it really quick."






"Please don't be stupid."






McAfee VirusScan - E-mail scan completed successfully. No virus found!

"I'm outta here."  And there went my better judgement.






"Strange...nothing but garbage binary.  I'll just delete it."






CANNOT DELETE.  FILE IN USE.






"No it's not in use!  It's a stupid text file.  Delete!"






CANNOT DELETE.  FILE IN USE.






<Banging head against keyboard> "NO, it's not.  Delete!  Garbage can!  Gone! </Banging head against keyboard>






CANNOT DELETE. FILE IN USE.






"Fine"
