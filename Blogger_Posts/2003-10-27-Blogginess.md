# Blogginess
Date: October 27, 2003

Welcome to a new week of blogginess.  (I created a word, today hey hey)



It looks like the site is in full swing now.  With a little bit of luck, I hope to have a little bit of business flow from this.  This weekend, Wife and I had more free time to ourselves than usual, so we hit the favorite spots.  Olive Garden, Hungry Howies, and of course, Best Buy.



My wife is a dear.  And when I say a dear, I am trying to illustrate that she is the most thoughtful, kind, and loving person I know.  This short story must begin with the understanding that my cell phone was in dire straits.  Utter despair, I mean, for crying out loud, the last legs of cell-phone-ness.



So on Saturday night, the last straw.  My charger broke while it was still in the cell phone.  Thing weren't really going smoothly for me that night anyway, I had tried using the barbeque outside of my apartment for the first time, and I couldn't figure out the blasted starting mechanism.  No matter, inside the house I went with the meat.  Wife suggested we use the George Foreman grill.



Once bite was enough for me.  It tasted like burnt ashes.  Oh, there were a few other happenings  that went totally awry, but we don't need to go into them.  Suffice it to say that the cell phone incident placed me firmly over the edge.



My wife decided, spur of the moment, to take me to Best Buy (my favorite store!) and get me a brand new cell phone.  This was the one that I had been craving for the longest time.  So here it is, and now, I share with you a picture of my cat, courtesy of my nifty camera phone.
