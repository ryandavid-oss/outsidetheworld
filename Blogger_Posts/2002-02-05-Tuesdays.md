I never could get used to Tuesdays...






Tuesday must be the red-headed step child of the week. And, come to think of it, February very well could be the same in relation to the months of the year. Perhaps this is why i'm having a bit of difficulty grasping a hold of this time of my life. I had to head home from work early again today. Apparently none of the food which i had partaken of in the past day wanted to stick around any longer. So it proceeded to push and shove its blessed little way out the way it came. Poor food. My tummy (gut? stomach?) must not have been a very hospitable host today.






I'm in the process of finding a good host for my new website...coming in the next couple of months. If any of you all have any suggestions in regards to which host would do dandy for my website, just let me know. I have a few really cool ideas for the site, and i'd like to make it a little more interactive. I would really like to steer clear of any ads and keep it as simple as possible. 






Someone must be home...the light's on.
