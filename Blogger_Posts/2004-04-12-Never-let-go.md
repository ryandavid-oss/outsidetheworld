# Never let go
Date: April 12, 2004

One visit after another.  Sumner is quite the popular boy.  From proud grandparents to curious neighbors, this little baby has caused an increase in visits for our family, indeed.  He's a genuinely serene child, and when I hold him in my arms and look at him, I feel nothing but love for him.  It's shocking how easily they grab a hold of your heart strings.  I just hope that he never lets go.






Mommy is still doing wonderful, if not slightly euphoric.  The most beautiful thing to watch is both of them sleeping in bed, his little head somewhat crooked in her arm.  Earlier this morning, we were cleaning out all of our bags from the hospital when she told me that she really enjoyed her stay there.  At first, I was incredulous, but after pondering the entire experience, I had to agree.  From the moment we got to the hospital, we completely felt comfortable and cared for.  The delivery, and every moment leading up to it, was spent together and in total confidence.






I don't know how common it is for couples to have this great of an experience during delivery, but I do know that I am and forever will be grateful. 






A couple of weeks off.  As my job offers paternal leave, I will be off for the next couple of weeks to be with my family.  That means that I should have plenty of time to regularly update this forsaken blog and Web site.  Friendly contact of encouragement is recommended, of course.  And as always, we welcome any visits or calls.  The door is always open.
