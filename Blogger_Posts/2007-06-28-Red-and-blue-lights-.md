# Red and blue lights!
Date: June 28, 2007

Nope, definitely not most people's favorite things to see while driving to work in the morning, but this ended happily enough.Turns out the officer simply couldn't see Sumner in the back seat and, well, I was in the carpool lane after all. He bid me farewell with nothing more than a repair slip for my windshield. (which i'll get fixed soon, honest!)I thought about photoblogging the experience, but then my brain started working again. Posted wirelessly, on this most anniversary of days.
