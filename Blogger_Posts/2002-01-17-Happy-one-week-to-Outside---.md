# Happy one-week to Outside...
Date: January 17, 2002

It's been a weeks worth of writings and i'm feeling pretty good about the whole thing. Now, if i only knew how to archive these things i could make it so you wouldn't have to wait for a week's worth of writings to load. Oh well, i think it's just been one of those days, where nothing really made a whole lot of sense to me anyway. Even at work, whenever someone would ask me to do something, i would just look at them like they had 3 arms or as if they had just asked me to sprout wings and fly to the moon. I was supremely glad when 5 o clock rolled around. Oh wait, never mind, i left at 4:00. Yep, it was that long of a day... 






Today when i was listening to the radio, the DJ said something that caught my attention. Apparently, someone has decided to create a statue memorial out of the now-famous picture of the three New York Firefighters hoisting the American flag over the rubble of the World Trade Center. I thought that was great. Then came this, that due to political correctness, they were going to make the 3 firefighters white, black and Hispanic. The men in that picture, however, are all white. Now before you get your knickers in a bunch, listen to me. I'm all for racial equality and not for pissin' people off, but let's get one thing straight. You do not rape history for the sake of being politically correct. Yes, i know black firefighters lost their lives in that fire. And many Hispanics perished also. But you know what? A lot of women died in that disaster too. Why not just put a 4th person in the statue and oh, let's make that one a woman. And hey, since we've already ruined the historical accuracy of that poignant moment, let's add a fifth person and make him gay. Then we won't piss anyone off. I honor and respect every single person that died that day. Regardless, one day i will visit this statue and, at the steps of this great tribute to the lost, i will shed the same tears of sorrow. But it breaks my heart that we take this insatiable desire to please people over the edge and shove aside fact for crowd-pleasing fiction. 






*phew* I'm done now. See you on Friday.
