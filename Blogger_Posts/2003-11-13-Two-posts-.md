Maybe tonight, I should write my entry before I work on my Web site for four hours...



On my way home from work today, I had the rare experience of jet skiing the entire way.  It must have rained at least an inch throughout the time when I was at work, so the streets were flooded, as was my apartment parking lot.



I have a scooter that gets me to and from work (what's that?  Shut yo mouth) and I found it terribly enjoyable to tear through the water in it tonight.  As my back tire left a wake behind me, I didn't even give a second glance to find out if I splashed any unfortunate on-looker.



The funny thing is that kids love that scooter.  I can't remember how many times those little tikes have asked me if they could ride it.  Sure, kids.  Go ask your mom.



Yoinks.  Gone.



Can't really remember where I was going with this, but I'll try writing more later.

Well, that was a huge failure.  If there is one thing that I have learned from writing these on a nightly basis, it's this:  If you have nothing to say, don't keep typing.



Good day to you all!
