# Greetings, and why I'm not married
Date: April 25, 2002

Greetings to you this fine day...

 


It's funny to think about life sometimes. I only say this because i'm waiting for the bad to come at any time now. I was able to get rid of my Honda and find a much more suitable car for my purposes, and i have what appears to be a dream job at a growing company. I'm happy, i have friends, the weather is still too hot, but that won't change till October. No rain. But nevertheless, life is cruising along at an incredible pace. In the words of Elder Nielson, life's so good, it's scary...

 


This week has been spent mainly in the classroom at Cox. I won't delve into this too much since i may be divulging too much information, but know that it is both challenging and fun. I believe that i can stay a while at this company. This weekend, my friend Neal will be flying home from Idaho to spend a week in between semesters with his family. It'll be good to see him and spend some time with him before he leaves again for school. He is the last remnant of my friends that aren't married yet, a rare and highly (not) coveted rank on the Totem pole of life. No, really. I swear.

 


Why am i not married? Because i don't know. Why aren't you married? And don't give me anything like, "well, actually i am" because that doesn't cut it with me anymore. I need something more substantial to go on here, not just a reception invitation to pad your list of presents. Want to know how many receptions i've been to in my life? 3. My brother's, my ex girlfriend's, and my best friend Jake's. I may, and i can't confirm this, but it's a pretty safe bet, have a fear of commitment. Who knows, who knows.

 




Well, have a wonderful weekend. Catch you on the other side of Sunday...
