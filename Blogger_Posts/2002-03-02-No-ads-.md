Welcome to the new site. For the time being, all will remain the same except the actual address, but this marks the successful transition from the old server to the new. Check back often, you never know when you may find new stuff.






I walked out this morning...


It was like a veil had been removed from 


before my eyes.


for the first time i saw the work of heaven...


in the line where the hills had been 


married to the sky.
