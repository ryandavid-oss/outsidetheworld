# Lazy Sundays
Date: January 05, 2004

I know I've said it before, but I'm at liberty to say it again:  Lazy Sundays are nice.

It may be silly to post cat pictures as much as I do, but there simply the best representations of feelings of relaxation.  Not since my father has anyone been able to sleep so professionally.  And I mean that with the utmost respect, of course.






I had to work on Saturday, so that blew most of the weekend plans.  I had one specific idea that could have surprised my wife, but now, that'll have to wait until next weekend. 






New Pictures.  You may wish to visit the Media page of this site, for there you'll find the best in photographic excellence.  Ironic though, they aren't mine.  I receive a digital camera for Christmas, and post-holiday, the only things I have to grant are my brother's capturings.






Nonetheless, they're absolutely beautiful works, and I wanted my brother to be able to post them online.  He and his family of eight live in Spring City, Utah, and I honestly believe that it's one of the most serene places I've visited. (I haven't been very far)  It snowed several inches over the weekend in this little town of 700.  The entire vista is encompassed in brilliant white spectacle.  I had my brother take his digi-cam out into the open and give me a look.






I was just discussing with him how odd it was that he could have children in this small town and the population actually increases noticeably.  I believe he described it as anachronistic, and that it is.  I have never experienced life as he does.  In many ways, I wish I could.  There are more people in my apartment complex than there are in his town.






That's all that I have for today, but only because I'm distracted.  Come back tomorrow if you feel so inclined.
