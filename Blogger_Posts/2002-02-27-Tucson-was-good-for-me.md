# Tucson was good for me
Date: February 27, 2002

It was a chance to get away and recoup from the previous weeks' happenings. But i always hate coming back from somewhere fun like that, it's like eating 50 sugar packets and finding you have the energy to run up the wall across the ceiling, only to crash out of your high 35 seconds later and fall flat on your face in horrible spectacle. My friend Eric and I met up with some of his friends to go to an Ice Hockey game (and you may ask, what other type of hockey is there?) I dunno, i just always call it ice hockey. So anyway, we went to this ICE hockey game and U of A won, they were playing ASU so the whole arena was packed. Eric has some cool friends down there; Sara, Jaime, Dan, Erica, and others...i wish i could remember all of their names. So, hello to all of them. I doubt they'll even read this anyway.






Work work work. I've been waiting to hear back from Cox Communications, i've desired a job there for months now. But no word yet, so i plug away at this fine engineering firm that i've been so blessed to be employed by. Other than that, there is very little going on in my life...although i've decided to go to California for a couple of days with my newfound friends from Tucson. It's almost been a year since i've placed a foot on that strange soil, it will be kind of nice to go back. I doubt that i'll even have any chance to see my friends there, much to my chagrin, but that's life. 






Check your house and see if there's a light bulb that needs replacing. Your eyes will thank you.


Unless you stare directly at every light bulb in the house. Then they might get a bit sore after a while.


Use sunglasses. If anybody asks why you are wearing them, just tell them it's better than not not wearing them. After thinking about this for a while, they'll probably leave you alone...
