I saw this motel one night as I was picking up some pizza for the family. In the brief interlude between driving there and back, I observed the basic contrast that occurred when the neon lights were switched. 

And thus starts a new theme for TiPP. 

If anyone has subject matter ideas for Day + Night, drop me a line in the comments.
