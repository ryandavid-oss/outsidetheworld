# The Spirit Lands
Date: January 07, 2004

The seventh already?  The year is already speeding by.  What happened to the holidays?






Every year, I seem to have the same cooling-down period after New Years.  At times in sleepy stupors, I will wake up and completely forget the day and whether Christmas and New Year already happened.  I suppose this is unique to me, and it's probably an indication that I could use a little more excitement in my life.






News:  The Spirit landed...and it gave us 12 Megapixel photos!  This was fun news for me to read this morning, and even more enjoyable to view these pictures from another planet.  Let me repeat that.


Pictures from another planet.






It's hard to grasp, is it not?  I've tried to visualize it...our little Martian lander strolling about on the surface of a planet 180 million miles away from where I stand.  And somehow, this little remote control car is beaming high-res full-color shots of the red planet's surface to Earth.  Come again?  Next thing you know, those NASA scientists will figure out how to bring one home...






If you have the time, take a look at the slideshow presented by MSNBC. 






In other news:  I have a full three day weekend coming up, and therefore have planned a small adventure with my camera.  I hope to bring back more than a few worthy shots, having already promised my elder brother as much.






Wife went to the Doctor today, just a regular pregnancy check-up.  Everything looks ok, and next appointment, she gets to look forward to the glucose test.  I have here in front of me a strange viscous looking orange liquid.  Apparently, she must drink this entire sweet beverage on the morning of her next visit.  It just looks awful, and I feel bad for her.  I mean, isn't pregnancy bad enough without making these poor girls drink a strange orangey syrup?  I told her to take it on the rocks.  (joking)


If you've ever wanted an archive of all of the pictures that I've placed on the Blog (and I'll bet you a pair of cheese straws you haven't), you can find one here.






What a pleasure the Blog has been.  I appreciate those who keep coming back.  I'll see you again tomorrow, same place as before.
