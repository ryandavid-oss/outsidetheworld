# Rain
Date: January 30, 2002

The rain came!






I woke up this morning and peered out my window at the clouds and hoped it was so. Sure enough, the rain was falling from the sky and cleaning the air. I breathed deep the aroma of fresh rain and sighed, this was all that i needed to start feeling better. The sickness is slowly but surely leaving the body. For those that don't live in Arizona or who haven't experienced the rain here, it's some of the sweetest smelling rain around. No salty fragrance from the ocean or lake, nothing but clean desert air. Chances are that it won't last too long, but while it's here i might as well enjoy it. 






I forgot to mention that it was Eric's birthday yesterday...happy birthday. 21 years old. So now i guess you don't have to feel bad anymore when they say on TV, "must be 21 or older to enter". Yes my 21 year old friend, disclaimers have no hold over you. Unless of course, you never really cared about that in the first place, in that case you can just ramble on with your life as usual. Yep.






Nothing much else to report as of this moment. Good day, ya'll.
