# Unexcused absence
Date: October 19, 2004

We ought to begin with a rhetorical question.  But we won't.  There are simply too many questions, and most of them are arrogantly rhetorical. 






I can't help it, however.  Where have I been?  Why did I see fit to dispose of this Web site for over six months?  Haven't the past months been filled with enough viscosity to fill page after page? 






Decide for yourself.  While you are pondering, find the joys of solid food here. (Note:  This file is much too large for my Web site, but I'm much too lazy to create a smaller one and my the looks of things, I ain't using too much bandwidth.)






Hopefully, maintaining a Web site is similar to riding a bike.  If it's not, I'll have a nasty time of getting back into the swing.  I've already surprised myself by remembering my username and password, and the fact that I can still type and think at the same time is rather encouraging.  If I can find and promote some type of regularity with this, then I may be eligible for some flavor of medal or trophy.  Definitely not a pizza-trophy, though.






As you can see by the video provided earlier, Sumner has changed by leaps and bounds.  No longer is he completely bound by the chains of gravity; on the contrary, he loves to test his limits on a daily basis to see how much more movement he can attain.  He loves Cheerios, and has found a fondness for all types of juices.  I finally talked mom out of watering everything down, although that may not have been such a good thing. 






Secondly.  I must apologize to any who came to this page on any type of regular basis.  And by regular, I do include those who passed by once a month.  Judging by the looks of the meter, six visits per person is rather generous.






That's plenty for tonight.  I think that I have loosed the bonds of writer's block for now.  Pray that I stick with it, these are probably the years for which I will want to have some sort of record.  Cheers.
