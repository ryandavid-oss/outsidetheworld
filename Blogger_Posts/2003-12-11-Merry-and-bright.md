# Merry and bright
Date: December 11, 2003

Greetings on this fine Thursday.  Warning:  Extreme laziness today.  Not much below.






Today, I had a day off.  It was needed because I had a doctor's appointment to attend to at 4:00pm.  Too bad, because I forgot about it entirely.  My wife had to remind me about it about a gazillion times, (special note, gazillion also appears to be acceptable to Word's spellchecker) and I still forgot. 






Now, something for the rest of you.  MSNBC has a neat Digital IQ test.  I took it, wife did too, as did my brother and parents.  Go ahead and take that test and then come back here. 






I won't tell you what I got, as that is unimportant in this case.  And the fact of the matter is that it's entirely lop-sided on the downward cycle.  If you haven't got a home network or if you don't know what bluetooth is, then you're in for a rough time.






Many MSNBC readers who completed this IQ test sent its creator a word or two.  I found the following entry quite amusing:






Name: Ryan

       Hometown: Mesa, Ariz.




Just like stereotypical nerds, the people who aren’t scoring high get all flustered and upset because it strips them of their geekness — the only thing that they have.






Digital IQ isn’t about who sets up the most elaborate wireless network ... it’s also about knowledge of Internet culture. Teen Girl Squad, anyone? (Kudos if you know what this is)






As for the “Web site designer” who says you suck for not using Mozilla ... he suffers from typical hypergeekism. To mimic the years of abuse from their peers in grade school, they continue to abuse themselves by using outdated and/or inferior technology so they can be L33T.






They love to make everything difficult. “Ha? Use an FTP Client? I do all my work command-line. Outlook? Are you crazy? I spent a few weeks writing my own JAVA app for that. I might share it with people on my Website. Check it out — new messages are in 0000FF.”






And don’t get me started on the “OMG, I HATE OFFICE AND MICROSOFT. Y R U USING IT, N00B???” people.






For the record, I got 120 on the quiz. Again, its more about culture than engineering, n00bz.






I simply found that refreshing.  If you missed the Web site above, you can find that here.  Anyway.  (do I say that too often?) Since I've provided you readers with a different picture every day of this week, I had better stick with the program and fuzz you another cam-shot.






Run phone_pictures.exe: ....cat....cat....cat....Wife....cat....


(something's definitely wrong here)






Ah, here we go.

Is this a house aflame?  Nope.  It's just my fuzzy camera phone ,and it appears that Frosty may have gotten himself in a jam.

Please, don't put Frosty on your roof.  He just doesn't belong there.   How is he going to get down?


14 days left!  May your days be both merry and bright!)
