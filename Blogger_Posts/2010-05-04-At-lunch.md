# At lunch
Date: May 04, 2010

Sitting here, minding my own business.  Simply reading news articles on my iPad, when I notice two "gentlemen" laughing in my general direction. I notice a windows based net book on their table. I shoot them a look that quite possibly corrupted their registry.

They leave without giving me another look.

I smile.

I have no issues with other peoples' technology choices. Really, I don't. But give me a break. Don't knock it till you try it.
