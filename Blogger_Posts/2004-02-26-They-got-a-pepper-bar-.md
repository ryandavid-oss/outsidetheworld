# They got a pepper bar!
Date: February 26, 2004

I've got Ben Folds playing in the background, the latest beta test is downloading slowly, so let us begin.






I'm not going to beat around the bush.  GREATEST COMMERCIAL EVER.






And just what is the greatest commercial, you ask?  None other than Quizno's strange spong monkey spots. If you haven't yet viewed these, you may view them both here.  The basic premise is fairly standard; these small furry mysteries attempt to get you talking about their commercial.






It begins with one furry creature singing a crazy song about their subs, a bowler hat atop his (her?) head, while their friend is in the upper corner with an 18th century sailor's hat plucking away at a guitar. 






Sure, the voice is funny.  Yes, the little creatures are  amusing.  But the greatest part of this commercial, the part that absolutely makes me double over laughing on the floor, it the part where there is a longer pause, followed by the line "They got a pepper bar!"






I don't know what a pepper bar is, I don't really care, but this commercial has me sold.  I'm going, first chance I get.






And by the way, just in case you're wondering what a "spong monkey" is, it's a creation from the United Kingdom that appeared on the Net a little while ago and became a pop culture icon there.


And yes, either you love this commercial, or you hate it.  But I belong to the former group.  I have to give this ad an "A".  I think that they should market a stuffed animal.






In other news:  I've decided to do something drastic to get my daily visits up.  I haven't decided just what that's going to be, but there's been quite a drop off in visits this month.  Sure, I could attribute that to the fact that I haven't been writing, but I'll be naive and just assume that everyone is bored with the same old.






Will it be music?  Will it be pictures?  A new story? Let's take a vote.
