# Basketball game
Date: January 14, 2004

Only a picture for today.  Tonight, my wife and I went to the Suns game, as she had won tickets (I'd probably never pay to see them, unless they were playing the Utah Jazz, in that case, I'd be paying to see the Jazz)  The game was ultra-boring, and that's being nice.

The only reason that I went was to see number 15.  Carmelo Anthony, one of the youngest players ever in the NBA.  I wonder how many times we'll say that...eventually, they'll find a way to get a 17 year old in, as long as he's graduated from High School.
