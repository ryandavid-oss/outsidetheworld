# A friend for Dobby (nope, not gonna happen)
Date: November 01, 2003

Today:  An extra special weekend edition of the blog, in all its glory!



Well, I put some of the finishing touches on my Professional Web site today.  For any of you who may pass by this site, please tell me what you think!  Additionally, I would appreciate any word-of-mouth advertising that you could offer.



This morning, I left for Petsmart on my scooter to purchase Dobby some essentials, i.e. litter and food, and upon my arrival back at home, I found a small kitten outside of my door.  Coincidence?  I doubt it!  I took him inside, bathed him, tried to feed him (at least, I think it was a he?), and dried him all up.



He attacked Dobby.  Wrong thing to do.



So, I took him to a shelter.  But now, I have a problem.  I want another kitty.   And I think Dobby deserves a friend too, with Wife and I being gone so often.



Anyway, so please, refer someone to the site. If you want business cards, put in a request here, and I'll mail them promptly!  Have a good weekend!
