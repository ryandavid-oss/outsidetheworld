# Birthday
Date: March 08, 2004

So, chickens can climb stairs.  We were awoken this morning by some peculiar and rare news.  My wife seemed to think it was mildly amusing, but if she only knew the quickening pace of my heart when she told me, she would have instantly known that she made my day.

There was a rooster out in our front yard.   Maybe the only reason that I got excited was because it was genuine camera fodder, for there is blessed little to capture around an urban apartment complex. 






The neighborhood kids were thrilled with delight; there were a few of them who were set on the idea of catching this lost bird.  But I could remember from my summer in Ephraim, Utah that it's not really possible to capture one of these birds without a little bit of formal training. 






The older neighbors were abuzz.  It seems we don't get much excitement around here, eh?  The apartment staff was there too, walkie-talkies in hand, wondering what to do about this rogue farm animal.  Luckily, one of the girls that worked at the office had a husband that knew a thing or two about these birds, and actually raised a few hundred in his life.  So he came straight over to get it.  That's fine, because I was growing weary of my neighbors jokes about a chicken dinner.

Last week, Quiznos.  This week, KFC?








In other news:  It's birthday time, and I have the day off.  It's time to go shopping.  The wife got me some neat-o presents this morning, including a much-coveted propane lantern.  How'd she know that I wanted that?  Easy.  She's the best.  She also left early in the morning to get me my birthday cereal.  That is simply a tradition that cannot die.  Although it appears now that other families have jumped on that wagon, as my wife came home with a box of "Birthday Trix".  When I sat down at my desk to scribble off this entry, I was also greeted with an e-mail from my brother, wishing me a happy day with a Pay Pal present in tow. What a wonderful start to a wonderful morning.






Poultry and sugared cereal, propane lanterns and active Pay Pal accounts.  What a day.  See you tomorrow!
