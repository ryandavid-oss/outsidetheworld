# Two scoops
Date: March 10, 2004

Kobe says the Jazz are out of the picture.  Too bad he doesn't understand that they don't want him anyway.  If the Jazz front office ever expressed interest in him, not only would I be surprised, but I'd be willing to bet their offer was extremely modest. 






You know what an exceptional organization looks for when they sign players?  It's not just talent.  It's not the experience, the rings, or the publicity.  It's the character of the man himself, and Kobe hasn't got it.  He bemoans the Jazz organization because their skit involving him was "just not right."  He was quoted as saying that he was angry because the skit made fun of Karl Malone.  I disagree.  I believe he was upset because the skit exposed him a little bit more than he found comfortable.






He stated that events such as the skit on January 24th must be taken into consideration when choosing teams.   However, when you A. Have been charged with rape and B. Continue to care about your pocketbook above winning, it does not reflect well when pursuing another team.






The media and press state that the Jazz "poked fun" at his legal troubles.  Regretfully for Kobe, this digs much deeper than sheer legalities.  If convicted, he could face years of prison and/or a life-time of probation.  He has to rebuild his carefully crafted image from the ruins that he himself created.  I  wonder why he doesn't watch his words more carefully.   In my opinion, he has an insurmountable task ahead of him.  He may be acquitted,  he may continue to play basketball at a level others envy, but he will never, ever earn the respect of millions again.






So why devote so much space to this?  Because to me, this type of stuff matters.  It's just another compass for the way the world turns, another drop in the bucket that has overflowed.






Phew.  Sorry about that.  In the future, I will give ample warning when entering extreme screed mode. 






Camping.  Again.  Over the last weekend, I went on another camping trip with some buddies of mine.  This time, we didn't forget the firewood, and we even brought charcoal briquettes and a load of mesquite chips for a bit of flavor.  My oh my, steak does taste better when not prepared over a bustling flame of dura-log.






Alas, this may be my last trip for a while, as the time draws ever nearer for the birth of our son.  In five weeks, life will change dramatically.  In the meantime, I had better set things straight around the res' and spend as much time with my wife as possible.  I don't feel oppressed by the pending arrival; however, there comes a point when you finally realize there never was a point to turn back.  The implications of the responsibility of a child are astounding, at best.    Everyday I think quietly to myself.  Everyday I find myself more drawn to this person that I have never known.  Everyday I become more of a father, and the boy inside of me is transferred to the soul inside my wife's belly.  At first, it was an unwilling process, fraught with tears and confusion.  Now, it's more of an honor.  Expectations are that this young boy will soon be my son.  Aspirations are a great deal higher.






That's it for now.  I decided to write this entry a little early tonight so as to grant myself a little more free time to pursue other venues.  I may return later tonight, but most likely not.  Regardless, I'll be doing the same thing for the foreseeable future, like it or not.  Cheers!






03/10/04 @9:28pm.  Honestly, I didn't expect to return tonight.  But while what I have to say is brief, I couldn't keep it for tomorrow's entry.  I just went for a ride around the adjoining neighborhoods on the ol' scooter.  I love this time of year.  Every scent is enhanced and magnified by the cool night air.  I don't feel a rush to get inside to warm up; instead, I can keep my head up as I stroll about outside. 






I even caught a hint of some orange blossoms in the area.  That's an event that has become less and less common, I'm afraid.  It used to be that everywhere you went, you could inhale the heady aroma of the nearby orange groves.  Now, you must make due with the occasional orange tree.  But it still smells great.






This time of year is what living in Arizona is all about.
