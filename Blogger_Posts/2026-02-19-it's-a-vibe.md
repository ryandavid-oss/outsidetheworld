Hallelujah, folks.  We are back online and fully ready to rock this site back into existence.

For the longest time, I have fallen back on 3rd party tools and services to help me post my thoughts to the ether.  This was my mechanism for years after I fell into silence while my life took the crazy train without me as a passenger.  But I digress.

My original site was near pure HTML, with each page created lovingly within Microsoft FrontPage (remember that?) 

Well now, we are back to pure code, but instead of me having to learn from scratch, I am using Gemini to "vibe" with me as I tell it what I want and where I want it.  I even created a native posting tool so that I can leave Blogger behind.  

So stay tuned, for more magic is guaranteed to manifest itself as the days go on...
