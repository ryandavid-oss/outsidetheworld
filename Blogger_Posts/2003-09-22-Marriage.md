# Marriage
Date: September 22, 2003

Good evening, wherever you are.






It's been ages since i've written my material...mainly because there was simply too much to catch up on. In a nutshell:






Marriage.






I was married to a beautiful girl on June 28th, 2003. Remarkable girl, really, and what's more, she puts up with me. Everything. Every last bit. And I love her, and she loves me. What more could you ask for?






I'm well into year two at work now...and am now schooling my body through life. I attend Ottawa University with my wife, and I've chosen a major. I'll stick with secondary education...which is different than regular education, I suppose. I suppose a lot of things at 12:18 in the morning, really...especially shoddy, flung-together writing. Ho hum.








That'll be it for now, back later. I'll archive my previous stuff for you.
