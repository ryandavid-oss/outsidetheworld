# What is an imp
Date: January 22, 2004

Did you know that stucco can be removed solely by using hot water and a scraper?  I didn't know that.  And while I'm mentioning things that I don't know, let me add that I don't know why anyone would stucco the entire inside of their house.  That just bamboozles my mind.






Let me clarify by saying that no one that I know personally has stuccoed their house.  However, in a quest to help my dear mother-in-law with removing a bit of stucco from her fireplace, I ran across many stories on the Web of people attempting to remove stucco from the entirety of their home.  *shudder*






New Blog Link.  You may want to check it out.  It was introduced to me through my brother and fellow blogger, Adam.   The site itself is called Lost Coyote.  Good stuff.






In other news:  Life just keeps rolling along, giving no heed to the weary or forgetful.  Like I said yesterday, it's extremely hard to summarize entire missed days in one entry.  I find the pace of life marvelous.  I sometimes have so many goals that I miss the mark on a few.  By and large, the goals get accomplished or they get set aside, but never cast off. 






Sometimes I have to remember where I've been by looking at my bank statement.  I'm so much more busy now that I have a wife and an apartment and a car and a crazy cat.  Bear with me as I have a child.  I might just feel so sorry for myself that I'll realize how easy I had it.






I'll quit yacking, back on track now.  Above, you'll see my new graphic.  Whenever I open Photoshop, I end up creating something new.  I find a unique solace in graphic design, I have since I first saw Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark.  And while the design and art that I create are not that amazing, it calms my mind as I move binary colors around. 






I feel the same way about most digital forms of art, I suppose.  Digital Photography brings me a type of instant result not found in any other form of media.  The creation of digital music grants me the authority to be as ridiculous as I want.  And digitally editing video, once empowered only to those with money (and skill), has been given to everyone. 






Google.  This is just super.  Can I say that?  I regularly check my site statistics, just to see where I'm at and catch a glimpse of where my visitors are coming from.  In just the past week, I've seen a marked rise in both search engine hits and random visitors.  That's good news.  Why, you can punch in the words "Cucina Tagliani's" and there I will be, right on the top of the second page. 






I just hope no one is disappointed when they look for restaurant reviews and stumble upon the Blog.  Although, with as many words as I have on this site, one can search for many things and end up here.   Poor souls.






For example:






neil diamond's wife

chris cross

don't drown your food

what is an imp






The above mentioned random phrases manage to bring my site up.  Whatever.






The Move.  As this is Thursday's entry, I must make a valid disclaimer for Friday.  I'll be moving during most of the day time, and I don't know where my computer will be after the dust has settled.  So, an entry may be written, or it may not. 






See you later.
