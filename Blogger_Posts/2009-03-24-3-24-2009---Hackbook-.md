# 3/24/2009 - Hackbook?
Date: March 24, 2009

I ordered myself a new Dell Mini 9 "Netbook" today with the money I had been saving from my birthday.  They had a great deal going at only $199, though I did choose a few small upgrades.

Ship date isn't until mid-April, so I'm not holding my breath for a quick arrival.  But when it does get here, I'm removing Linux and installing OS X.  It should be a fun adventure.
