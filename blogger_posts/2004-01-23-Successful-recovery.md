# Successful recovery
Date: January 23, 2004

Successful recovery.  Ok, so I exaggerated yesterday.  The e-mail writing class did not do any serious damage to my writing, as many of the rules have now been assimilated into my collective verbosity.  No more knife through ice.






As I type this, my wife runs around behind me.  There are boxes upon boxes of stuff strewn about.  Who knew that two people could wreak such terror on a tiny one bedroom apartment.  And I wouldn't even call ourselves packrats, either.  Quite the contrary.  I throw away as many unneeded effects as I can throw a stick at.






My cat seems to understand that there's something going on, too.  He's moping about the house with an extremely dejected look on his face.  Yes, human expression is valid on animals, as proved by my feline. 






I suppose that I should get off my duff and help the cause.  It frightens me how many boxes there are.  So many boxes....*shakes head*






I'll see you on Saturday or Monday.  I make no promises for either.  Have a great weekend!
