# Burrito Bandito
Date: March 24, 2006

It's no small accomplishment that I'm actually going to post this blog before 11:00pm; every other night has been posted at that hour or much, much later.  Blame school, blame work, and blame...well, myself of course.  But tonight, there are far more important things than the blog.






Burrito Bandito.  This is a small Mexican restaurant that I found near my place of work, and I love it.  For $3.78 with tax, I can get a sizely bean and cheese burrito, a half order of Baby Banditos, and a drink.  Believe me, it fills me up. 






And for the third day straight, I have a picture!  'Cept this picture isn't of a sunset, labyrinth, or other such amusements. 






No.  It's my lunch.

Looks tasty, doesn't it?  I don't know what came over me when I took this picture.  I was not particularly impressed with the presentation; forgive me, but I'd seen this plate on numerous other occasions.  I just wanted to take a picture of my lunch, and let everyone see it.  And I wanted to tell you to try The Burrito Bandito.  It's at 19th Avenue and Union Hills Road.  Huzzah!






Technically, the last time I took a picture of my food was in the Missionary Training Center when I was 19 years old.  I would regularly take pictures of the grand portions there; after developing them (remember doing that?) I would send them to my parents, either as proof that I was eating or, more likely, to be completely obnoxious. 






Sheesh.  It's been quite a week.  This is it until Monday, I hope that you have found this week's postings slightly amusing, if not bemusing.  Yes, it truly is confusing to go from picture of post-rain sunsets to a styrofoam plate full of fried Mexican food. 






But what can you do?  Meet me back here on Monday and I'll try to make it up.
