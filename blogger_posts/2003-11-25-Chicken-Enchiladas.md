# Chicken Enchiladas
Date: November 25, 2003

Fairly quiet day, if I do say so myself.



In fact, it was so quiet that I really haven't much to say.  Wife made me my favorite dish tonight, I believe that I've mentioned them before.  She makes the most delicious chicken enchiladas I have ever tasted (and I've eaten quite a few).



Work today was much the same, except it went by very slowly.  I expect that this is because I only have two more days of work left until Thanksgiving, or Dia De Pollo.  I can remember back when I was serving my mission in New York City, around this same time of year.  I was so sick with the Flu, I couldn't move, I couldn't eat, I couldn't even talk.



I still believe till this day that I contracted that nasty virus from the wonderful health clinic where I received my Flu vaccination.  I don't believe that I'll ever try one of those again, thank you very much!



Anyway, I must be off...sorry about the extreme shortness of my entries lately.  I expect to have some lengthier entries later on in the week, and I'll be sure to write about all of the Turkey Day happenings.  Oh, on a sad note, this will be the first year ever that I do not participate in the Turkey Bowl.



More later!
