I must have a life less ordinary...



What exactly do I mean when i say that? Simple...as i drove home and felt the 60 degree weather flow in through my car window, I briefly remembered the poor seldom-correct weather man saying "record highs, upper 70's for today." Oh well. And as the clouds crashed together and made rain, i thanked God that i had been entertained on the way home from work. Oh yes, and this is whilst i was listening to Pink Floyd. The DJ couldn't have picked a better song at that time. Quite synchronous.



Upon returning to my house tonight i found spaghetti on the stove with my own sauce. MY OWN SAUCE. How many people in this world have their own blasted sauce when their mother cooks for them? I realized at this point that i am spoiled and the madness needs to stop. Oh, and i also downed a half stick of margarine on one slice of bread.

Go figure.



Things should get better as time rolls along, but this will do for now. I must see where this goes...
