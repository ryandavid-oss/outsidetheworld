# Pseudo-lit
Date: March 05, 2004

So, continuous nagging does work.  That's great.






It rained today.  Large amounts of torrential downpour, it was...Wife and I decided to go to Tagliani's to get some take out food.  I tried to convince her to stay at home while I left, but she would have nothing to do with that.  About 2 miles into the journey however, certain events wrought change upon her mind.  The rain came down in sheets, I tell you, and I couldn't see anything for the life of it all.  First, we have no windshield wipers on the driver's side.  Second, the brakes sound....well, they sound possessed.  It literally sounds like demons will leap from the depths of the discs and drums, for crying out loud.  And I do believe they were wretching by the time we got home.






It was kind of cute to watch her pray to herself in the passenger seat.  I could have said I told you so.  Wait a minute, I did!






Some sort of record?  That second paragraph was huge.  Completely unlike me.  I never write that large of paragraphs, and if I do, I have the insatiable compulsion to hack it up into pieces.  Doesn't make sense?  Doesn't matter!  All for the sake of aesthetics, mind you.  All in the name of pseudo-lit. 






The Passion.  Yes, I remembered.  I mentioned yesterday briefly that I would write a bit about this movie.  While I haven't seen it, I feel some sort of responsibility to explain. 






And don't assume that I won't attend.  I was waiting for something to happen before I gave myself time to ponder this film.  I wanted to see if a certain writer/critic/believer would say something about it, since he seems to have a great deal to discuss about everything else.






And I got my wish.  For those of you not familiar with Orson Scott Card, you definitely should.  He's a remarkable thinker with a keen mind for culture and society.  He has enough similarities to smaller folk to make him approachable, yet he possesses the intellect to request a certain amount of respect.






In the aforementioned article, he strips his essay into three distinct parts:  His views as a film critic, a believer, and an American.  It's not sappy in any way, and it really provides a three dimensional aspect to his opinion.  Because that's all that it is, beautiful opinion.






I was left to myself after reading the article, albeit none the closer to my goal of deciding whether to see this movie.  I like to make decisions for myself, but for this one, it seems a bit more thought and influence outside of my body is needed.  Sometimes I think too much.  I assume you're thinking the same exact thing.






New Links.  It's been a long week, and I'm happy to see two of my good friends begin writing again.  If you haven't taken a look at the links to the right, go ahead and check them out.  Difference of Opinion is the fine creation of my friend Eric, who is a Computer Science major.  Hence, the binary code as the back drop.  His rants are continually choice, and I'm glad they're back.






Heg's Thoughts is my friend Peter's site.  His writings are fewer and further between, but they are often more poignant and subtle.  Definitely worth a gander as well.






I deserve a break.  Thanks for the visits, it's always appreciated and this whole project will be back on Monday.  Until then.
