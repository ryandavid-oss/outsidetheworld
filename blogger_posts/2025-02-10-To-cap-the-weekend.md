I don't rightfully know how much life is left in this board of mine. But I'm glad I have it, still. The battery doesn't last like it used to, the back wheels are worn, the motor seems a bit out of balance…but she still moves. 



I've made the decision that when it dies, that's the end of it. I've had roughly 4.5 years with it so far, and haven't suffered a single scrape. Sure, there've been a few falls, a couple close calls, and numerous successful bailouts, but I think I've been pretty damn lucky. 



Next up, an electric bike. Speed with a bit more safety, I think.
