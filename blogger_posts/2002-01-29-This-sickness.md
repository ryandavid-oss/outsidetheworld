# This sickness
Date: January 29, 2002

Day 4 of what seems to be an interminable sickness...






I was thinking of putting some large wacky number there, instead of the 4. I was thinking, "that would be good for a laugh, eh?" But then the thought occurred to me that there's nothing funny about being this sick for this long. Nothing! Not a jot nor a tittle. I spent half of the day coughing, the other half aching, and the whole day wondering why i was at work when there was a perfectly acceptable reason to be in bed.






Blabbity blah. Where am i going with this entry? The same place as all of my writings, nowhere in particular. 






I'm hungry. Time to eat.
