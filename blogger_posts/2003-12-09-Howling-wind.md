# Howling wind
Date: December 09, 2003

Hah, well...I tricked you.



That's the problem.  You see, I didn't intentionally mislead you.  The date you see affixed to this entry is in fact the day when Wife and I learn more about our new child.  But the problem lies in the fact that I always (generally, can I say that?) write these entries on the night before.



So that means the smashing update that I promised simply has not yet occurred.



Bummer.  So, that means another short space of time for readers to wait.  But rest assured, I will most likely not make you wait until Wednesday morning to learn of the news.  I'll set to it right when I get home from the appointment.



The wind is howling outside tonight.  It started to really kick up when I left for lunch earlier today.  It's hardly a good thing when the vehicle you use weighs slightly less than you do.  It's a remarkably good thing that I only have to wander across the street on that scooter.  Which, by the way, my friend is interested in purchasing.  That would be a boon, says I.



So where was I.  Oh yes, the wind.  It actually makes it feel a tad bit wintry outside.  That does make me feel better, as earlier this month, Mr. Weatherman informed Arizona viewers that this month's weather would be unseasonably hot.  Not warm, mind you, but hot.  That's simply not the way that anyone wishes to begin their holiday season, especially someone like me, who at one point in his life, viewed ten feet of snow piled outside his bedroom window on any given morning.



Well, we take what we can get here in the land of the sun.



16 days till Christmas.  Might I recommend a gifts for you and yours?



This camera is smokin' I don't know if you can find a better deal on it, anywhere.



Let's take a surprise check at what my kitty is doing right now:



Dobby lookin shady...

Looks pretty shady to me.



Alright.  That's enough for today.  It's just sad when you have to draw upon the comedic prowess of your feline companion to keep your blog afloat on any given day.  Today, my friends...is simply not going to be one of those days.



Good day to you.  I'll see you tomorrow. (or less!)
