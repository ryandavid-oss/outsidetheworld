Much of the lack of activity on this site is because I'm bored. I no longer really look for things to shoot. I only shot this because I glanced up for a moment. Otherwise, it's too blasted hot to go hunting for shots outside. And inside?  We can all agree that without sufficient light, iPhone photos can be lacking. Lens: Tejas
