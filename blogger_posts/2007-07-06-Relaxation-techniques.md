# Relaxation techniques

Just go get a massage.  From a professional, mind you...not some random joe.  I found a combination oil change/massage clinic down in Mesa a few months ago.   What the heck is that?  Seriously, upon further thought, I don't want to know why they combined the two.   *shudder*The wife and I are out getting a massage at this time, in celebration of the four year anniversary.  I know, a little late, but it's the thought that counts.  I'm waiting patiently, hence the blog update.I have a feeling that this might read a bit disjointed, so I'm going to end for now.  Good day!
