Such a loaded word, right?

I have been more active lately in a few things.  Mainly Twitter, for the intent of this post.  Instead of merely consuming the viewpoints of so many distinct and vocally opposite voices, I have entered the mix and started to share some of my thoughts and ideologies.  Not trying to shout this from the mountains; rather, I am simply sharing my happiness that I have moved off the sidelines a bit.
Other news...hmm.
My youngest turned 12 this weekend, and it was a joy to spend time with her.  Having to split time with another parent is hard, but also means you cherish the time you do have a bit more.  Especially with the young ones. My youngest child has always represented sunshine to me. She still exudes it.
Fasting...something many in my faith do once per month.  I did yesterday, and it all fell apart.  Normally, hunger doesn't exacerbate my mood too much. But add in the headache that appeared late morning, and I was set up for failure for the rest of the day.  Any small or large stressor that appeared caused me to emotionally tailspin each time, thereby throwing the brunt of the fallout on my poor wife's shoulders.  
I need to make it up to her, somehow.
