My goodness.  Where have I been?



It's a long story.  It all started back at the end of the week of the 19th, when I began a new Beta project.  I found it necessary to format my computer, and in so doing, completely eradicated all of my Office software (including FrontPage).



Bummer.  So no worries, I simply had to reinstall my Office suite and move on, right?  Sadly, no.  Upon reinstallation, I found out, to my dismay, that the software had recently expired.  So, that brought an abrupt end to the blog and all other updates.



I wish that I could say that I had decided to take a break from writing, or that my Web site updates needed a hiatus for creative recovery.  Neither for the former...but we're finally back in business after the holidays.



Which, by the way, mine was wonderful.  Granted that New Years has not yet happened; however, I feel so estranged from that particular holiday that it really has no specific meaning for me.  Although, the resolutions this year should be predominantly meaty.  First, there's the not-so-small matter of rehabilitating my knee.  I continue to forget that I forked over a lot of cash so that I could play basketball again, and somehow, other things are taking front seat to that effort.



Then, there's that tiny event on the horizon.  I must prepare myself, both physically and mentally, for the birth of my son.  I just had to pause at that statement for a good 45 seconds.  I hadn't yet thought of it quite that way...my son.  It's not an unsettling feeling, really...more so, it's a startling realization that it's not just a game.  Please, don't get me wrong, I hadn't thought of fathering a child as a source of entertainment.  The mere thought hadn't crossed my mind.  But, sometimes parents get caught up in the romance of any given idea, especially child-birth, and more especially, the birth of their first.



No one has really provided us with the stern warnings that I thought came with this territory.  When Wife and I decided to wed, there were the usual talks and speeches about how it's not all fun and games, about how it's hard work and there will be tough times for any couple.  We understood that, and expected it (it hasn't yet happened, mind you...six months)



But doesn't anyone have any horror stories about children for me?  I've heard the poopie diaper dramas and the screaming-child-at-3:00am stories, but those are simply expected.  It's programmed in the parents hard-coding.  I want some real advice: I want some sit up straight and listen, dangit, because you've had it soft and you ain't got no idea what's in store kind of advice.



Or, maybe I don't.  Maybe that was a horrific tangent that I just delved into.  Spare me, for I think I may be going a little crazy.



Where was I.  Oh yes, New Years resolutions.  Yes, there's the customary "work out, eat better" resolution, too.  I'm anticipating a little assistance from my spouse on that one, though.  I've never made it more than three months into the year without pooping out in one form or another.  Although I think that I had a fairly good excuse last year, what with the engagement and wedding and surgery and all...but this year, no excuses.  Nothing, short of child-birth, will stop me from reaching my goal.



Oh, boy, am I in for it.



By the way, to elucidate further on Christmas day, it was a great one.  Dare I say it, it was the best one ever.  I got everything I could have wanted and then some.  Plus, I was able to make my wife happy with most of what she wanted.  I still think there may be something that I forgot along the line, but no matter.  We're both happy. 



Most notable, I received the digital camera that I so dearly wanted.  The biggest surprise came from my wife.  She managed to find the music-creation software that I wanted.  As a result of these gifts, additions will be in place in the Media page of my Web site.  Sweet deal.  You know what?  That deserves a graphic:

Oh yes.  See you tomorrow!  So much more to come!  Thanks for coming back. I'll be sure and make it worth your time.
