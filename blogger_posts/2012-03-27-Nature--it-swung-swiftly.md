Go ahead. Explain to these poor wildflowers how in Arizona, you can't predict springtime weather. Tell them that yes, it was 85 degrees a week previous, and they were welcome to bloom. Then confess that it snowed. It snowed, and sapped the life from these poor tender blossoms. A few days later, nature found equilibrium, and what remains is this damaged silhouette, drying in the setting 75° sun. Lens: Tejas
