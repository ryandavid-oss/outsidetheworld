# Thanksgiving
Date: November 27, 2003

Happy Thanksgiving!  Good news:  I didn't get sick.  So, I suppose that I over-exaggerated a bit.



Since today is a day off, I don't expect to say much.  When I awoke this morning, I decided that I should put a little bit of effort into this, though...since I have some free time this morning (rare).  Wife is out hiking with her mom right now, I would have gone, but my prohibits such activity at this time.



So, it's officially the time that we can begin listening to Christmas carols, donning our lights on the front porch, and (hopefully) start behaving a bit more kind toward our fellow men.  Oh yes, and we have to start shopping, too.



Now that I'm married, it's a lot different.  When I was single, I had the same people to shop for: Mom, Dad, brothers and sister.  A few friends along the way, too...but now, I have to shop for Wife.  I'm not saying that it's a chore in any way, but can you imagine the stress that's involved in an undertaking of this measure?



Couple that pressure with the fact that she says that she has so many ideas for gifts for me.  It makes me wonder if the ideas that I have for her are adequate?  I reckon so, but practically every hour of the day, I am pondering several different gifts for her in my head.



You see, I want it to be perfect.  Any suggestions?



The most peculiar song began playing on the radio...Neil Diamond's version of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas".  Isn't he Jewish?  Not that that is a reason why he shouldn't sing Christmas carols, it's just....rare.  Well, I suppose that paved the way for Barbara Streisand to sing them, too... (shudder)



Well, that's more than plenty for today.  Again, I wish you a happy Thanksgiving, and please, kick this holiday season off right.  Be a little kinder, share a bit more of yourself to others, and put a can of food in a donation bin.  And no canned beets.  Make it something the kids will enjoy!
