Much less to come tonight, I'm afraid...



It's a fine thing that I don't promise much.  I read a few of my previous entries from over a year ago, and I tended to wax toward unfulfilled promises a bit.  Nearly every weekend, I swore to post pictures of my adventures, only to come back empty handed.



But that may change, as I hope to get a new digital camera for Christmas.  The empty promises strike back!



Today crawled by, however the final hour of work was the worst part.  It was one of those days when you looked at the clock and swore that it hadn't progressed at all.  It even appeared to have taken turns at the opposite direction.



Yet the days can inch by like weeks, because the weeks are speeding along like days.  I fear that one morning, I shall awaken in cold sweats.  I'll check the calendar, and realize it's only April 18th.  You see where I'm going with this one.



So, we needn't go there again.



Wow, speelcheker didn't go bananas over the word "needn't".  Is that truly a word?  I love English.  Maybe I'll teach it someday?



Have a good day!  Less tomorrow?  Nah.  More tomorrow. (not a promise)
