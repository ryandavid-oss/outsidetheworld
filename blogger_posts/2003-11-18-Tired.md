# Tired
Date: November 18, 2003

I'm sorry.  I can't really think straight tonight.  I'm mind numbingly drained today.  I had big plans for my site, I was really going to go to town on a few pages.  But the minute hand paced by quicker than my will, and that will definitely take its toll on my ol' blog.



At least it's not a one-word entry, because I was going to simply leave it at the first line.



News:  Sting announced his new Tour.  Three minutes later, the site went down.  But for some reason, I doubt that it was because of a flood of traffic.  Rather, I suspect a very poorly designed Web site and an e-mail newsletter that was sent out prematurely.  Hmm.  So as of 9:01pm, I still have no clue of when Sting is to perform here in Arizona.



In other news:  Strong Bad has finally put my feelings into song.



Sheesh. I just read James Lileks' entry for today, and it appears to be a two parter.  More tomorrow!  What I would give to have enough verbiage for a decent one-parter.  But that's ok; my brother assures me that I should be there someday.  And I trust him, because I've trusted him before and it hasn't gotten me into too much trouble.



That's it for today, I'm afraid.  Sorry to disappoint.  But I'll be back tomorrow, and hopefully eight hours of sleep richer.
