# Small world
Date: January 16, 2002

The world truly is a small place.






I had one of those experiences today that made me say just that. Today at institute, after nearly 4 years of no contact, I met the sister of the man that was to be my brother in law.  I, being the loud nosey extrovert that i am, asked every person in my institute class what their name was and when i heard the last name of my sisters ex-fiancé (no, not dead. just in Utah, apparently), my jaw dropped to the floor. Equally, the person who i just met also had problems with their jaw when i told her my last name. There was a lot of talk of "how is she, how is he" nonsense afterwards, which i'm sure no one here really needs to know about. It was a nutty experience all the same. I'm just glad she married Kevin* rather than the other guy.






I committed myself to play basketball at 5:30am on Friday. 5:30. What was i thinking? Did i actually believe that i would be coherent at that hour? Let alone be able to move well enough to play. Ho boy, methinks i'm in for one long morning. What will probably happen is the alarm will go off and i will rationalize to myself all of my reasons for not getting up until it's too late to go. That's usually the way mornings work for me anyway.






I have a "bagel date" on Saturday morning. Just what is a bagel date you ask? Stay tuned and you'll find out...






*Paxman, Kevin. See relatives, marriage or People that i would like to beat in a vicious game of basketball.
