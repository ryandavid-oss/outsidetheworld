# It's a straight VIBE
### February 19, 2026

Hallelujah, folks. We are back online and fully ready to rock this site back into existence.  
  
For the longest time, I fell back on 3rd party tools and services to help post thoughts to the ether. This was my mechanism for years after I fell into silence while my life took the crazy train without me (with me?) as a passenger. But I digress.  
  
Back in 2000, my original site was near pure HTML, with each page created lovingly within Microsoft FrontPage (remember that?) I only once or twice "borrowed" code from sting.com, snowbird.com, etc...  
  
Since we're partying like it's 1999, OTW is back to pure code, but instead of learning from scratch, I am using Gemini to "vibe" with me as I tell it what I want and where I want it. I even created a native posting tool so that I can leave Blogger behind.  
  
So stay tuned,  more magic is guaranteed to manifest itself as the days go on...
