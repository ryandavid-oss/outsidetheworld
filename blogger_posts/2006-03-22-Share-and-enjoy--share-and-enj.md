# Share and enjoy, share and enjoy...

Just a short entry today.  To make up for it, however, I'm providing pictures for your viewing enjoyment. 






I'm already looking at the 11:00 hour as I write this.  Tuesday is the longest day of the week for me, with school and all.  And for whatever reason, class just crawled by tonight.  It was all I could do to keep from looking at the time.






There was a short unanticipated rain storm today in the valley.  When I left work at six, the clouds were barely breaking and the sun was shining in the best way imaginable.  The pollution had all been swept away; every mountain range within 100 miles was clearly visible with the orange sunlight casting textures upon them. 






I tried to take a few pictures to summarize what I saw.  Share and enjoy!
