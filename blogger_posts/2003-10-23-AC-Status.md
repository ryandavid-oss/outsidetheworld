For those of you out there that don't speak nerd, that means that my air conditioning unit is now working fine. The problem found? Blown fuse up on the roof. Time spent fixing it: Approximately 15 minutes. Minutes late to work? Approximately, no wait; exactly 3 minutes.






But I assumed it would come to that. The repair person (it happened to be a woman, it was) arrived unannounced at about 8:40 or so, and both Wife and I had to be off for our respective daily duties. But she assured us that it wouldn't be that long, that the problem probably lay up on the roof. 






Long story (already too long), she replaced the filter, too. It seemed evolution had sprung from it's dusty depths, but she ended that with one fell swoop.
