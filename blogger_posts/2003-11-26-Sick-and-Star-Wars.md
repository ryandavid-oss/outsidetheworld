# Sick and Star Wars

Today: Sick and Star Wars.



Here we go!  It's right on time.  I feel myself coming down with something, and oh, look...it's one day before Thanksgiving.  This means that I get to spend my Turkey Day feeling scratchy and stuffy again.  I think this makes eight years in a row, solid.



But, maybe I'm overreacting. I started to feel the customary twinge in the throat when I woke up this morning, and by afternoon, my head was pounding four-alarm style.   I simply have that whole-bodied yuckiness that leads to a cold...and by the looks of people around me at work, this cold season ain't pretty.



Enough of that.  I just finished watching Star Wars:  Clone Wars.  For those not yet introduced to this title, it is a series of five minute episodes, which detail the events between Episode two and three.



It's a marvelous display of animation.  From the beginning of the series, straight till the end, you can view the immense galaxy of Star Wars the way that it was meant to be seen.



Most notably, in the final (for now) episode, you find out exactly why Anakin Skywalker is described as a "brilliant pilot".  He swoops and dodges enemy fighters, constructs immensely intricate maneuvers, and brings down entire enemy strong holds with his trained mind.



Sadly, they have taken down the ability to view past episodes from their Web site, but rest assured that they will be back up in Spring of 2004, which is also when the final ten episodes will air on the Cartoon Network.



I think I'm going to fight this cold off with a bit of bed rest.  Until next time, keep checking back...I sense new changes afoot...
