# The Police
Date: October 24, 2003

I decided to listen to some Police CD's tonight. Man, this is fine, fine material. I'd prefer at this moment to have some old 45's to listen to, but I'd imagine only my brother would have access to those. I think that I'm missing out on something in the music by listening to it in digitally encoded bits.






Long day at work today. And by that, I mean, long with nine "o's". Wife is at work again tonight, so I get to hang out with the cat. Ho hum. There is only so much entertainment one can experience with a hyper kitten. I came home tonight to a ball of yarn strewn about the house in the shape of the Star of David, I'm wondering if the cat is trying to tell me something.






As a side note, you should never try to spray PAM on your oven rack. The end result is not pretty, and involves a great deal of smoke. Consider this: I learned my lesson the hard way. And my pizza tasted like plastic.






I finally got my hands on the new DVR unit that my employer has been touting for the past four months. It's quite a nice piece of equipment, and I'm sure Wife and I will enjoy the recording features. 50 hours of digitally recorded content ought to save just about 100 Simpsons episodes, but that's only if I had it my way. Actually, now that I think about, the Simpsons holds the same influence over her mind too. 








The cat just jumped up into my arms, which is making my typing very labored and difficult. That's my cue to end tonights little blog. Plus, he's right in front of my face now, and I can't se wht I m tyogng. Good nght. See ou next week!
