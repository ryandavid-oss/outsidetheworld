# Maybe, a poem?

For as far as you wish    
For as long as you stretch    
In the moment you lumber    
In haste, toward the mountain    
    
The general truth    
The uncourteous example    
Never minding the canopy    
Stretching, aching with heaviness  
  
Reminder, your cohort  
Believes in the coddling fervor  
The mind-numbing ache  
The key-turn freeing  
  
What's the angle, then?  
To a friend, just perspiration  
To our valley below, it's normality  
Do you remember the promise?  
  
So take wing to the summit  
Three paths, picked not yet  
We may celebrate not the gift  
And yet, burn pleasant all the same
