A special thanks to my friend Dan for letting me use his computer. My other friend Eric came back from U of A to find his parents computer completely dead, so i let him borrow mine for the weekend. 






I drove another 150 miles today for work, I'm half expecting my car to yell at me. Either that, or refuse to go anywhere anymore. Arizona roads can be torture, and the traffic makes it no better. Tomorrow: The fated bagel date. Too bad i forgot to call the person i'm going with...i ended up calling her at about 10:00 pm this evening. Yeah, that's me. I'm as smooth as silk when it comes to the women. 






Hope your weekend is memorable.
