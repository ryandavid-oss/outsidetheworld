# Disobedience
Date: October 21, 2003

Air conditioner status: Continued disobedience toward functionality.






I'm also debating whether to stack my blogs from bottom to top, or vice versa. Such is what I'm trying to think about right now as I type. Surprisingly, i found it much tougher to get back into my daily blogging now. 






I used to have a free mind when I wrote, I would extend myself into my blogs on a nightly basis. I really wanted something to be proud of; I wanted something that I could look back upon and be able to identify my exact state of mind at any one time.






James Lileks has a site that I strive to provide. Alas, I do not yet have the quirky style that that man possesses...I do not yet have the ability to observe the daily lives of individuals and extrapolate the tiniest details and turn them into cohesive literature.






But that man does, and soon, so soon, i wish to also. 






Anyway, sorry about the site, it's still under construction on a daily basis. Tonight, Wife and I went to our friend's house for a birthday party. Complete family and friends were there, and it was nice to be invited to that setting. Amidst the raucous laughter and crying baby, I could feel the tight knit bonds that held my friend's family together.






It's the same feeling I get when I'm around my Wife. And quite frankly, that just makes me that much more excited for Baby. (until I gain knowledge on the gender of the child, they will be called by the name of "Baby")








So, that's it for now, much more later. Anybody need a Web site?
