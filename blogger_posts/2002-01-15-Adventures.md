Adventures at the local Fry's Food and Drug store....






Today i had my first solo experience with the "automatic checker machine thingies"** at such stores as K-Mart and the like. I was sent on an errand to purchase Pepto-Bismol for someone at work because, well, because he needed it. I am proud to say that thanks to that fine automated machine i was able to buy the pink ooze in less than 20 seconds. And to my amazement, i found myself giddy afterwards, saying such phrases as, "that was cool" to the local Fry's supervisor. What a nut case.






I received an email from my friend Mindy today. She said that one of the phrases that i said in a previous blog was straight out of british play entitled "Rosencrantz and Guilderstern are Dead." Never read it before, but it is now one of my goals to do so. 






The door is always open. 






**For lack of a better way to put it, sure why not...
