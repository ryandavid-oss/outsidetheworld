# The state needs a bath
Date: January 28, 2002

I really wish i had something to write tonight.






But i don't. Why can't i just accept it? Because i don't want to, dangit. I'm 'fraid there's a mighty large number of things in life that we have to accept...but not being able to write tonight, well, that takes the taco. Oh, i know what it is, it's the pollution in the valley of the sun. Correction: Valley of the sun hidden behind 15 layers of dirt, smoke and dust. That must be clouding my mind of all things written.






What i wouldn't give for a monsoon storm the size of Alaska. This state needs a bath.
