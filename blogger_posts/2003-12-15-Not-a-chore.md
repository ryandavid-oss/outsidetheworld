# Not a chore
Date: December 15, 2003

I must say that I'm fairly delighted that this blog hasn't turned into a chore.  I enjoy writing too much for this to become tiresome.  Although I admit that at times, I spend about an hour conjuring up clever thought.  It hasn't yet come to me that easily.



And I will admit that the entries have been dry at times.  But as of this time, we're striving for quantity over quality.  The value will come soon.



I'm not looking forward to tomorrow.  It's been increasingly difficult to concentrate while at work, a direct result of the holiday season coupled with being married, I imagine.  My mind wanders with very little effort, and I'm sure that my performance is lacking in several measurable areas.



However, I have faith that this feeling will surrender itself after the holidays are spent, as Wife and I will begin counting down the days until Baby gets here.



It should be noted that I felt the baby kick this past week.  For those who have not yet felt this experience, I apologize.  It is a wholly remarkable feeling.  I've been quite jealous that Wife has felt these tremors lately, as I have waited quite patiently for this to become strong enough for me to feel.



Now, I can feel it whenever I want to (wife permitting).  I'm still excited and scared at the same time (cliché).   It depends on the day.  At times, I can picture it perfectly and serenely, holding the little infant in my arms and looking into his eyes.



And still other times, the more worrisome feelings creep into my head and I don't know how I'll keep up with things.



But in the end, the positive emotions always win, and I have faith in the fact that this baby will have the best parents possible.



Countdown status:  10 days.  Is everything in order?  We've still got ground to gain.  With that said, good look on your holiday endeavors, and I'll see you back here tomorrow morning.  Sorry, no picture tonight.  Tomorrow!
