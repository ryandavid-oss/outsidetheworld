			<font size="4" color="#2A6095"><b>07/04/2007</b></font><p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>Good morning, and welcome </b>to the Fourth 
			of July, a day to be spent reflective upon the foundation of our 
			country, those who sacrificed for it, and of course, to try and blow 
			a small portion of it sky-high.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#000000">That is, unless you live in Arizona.&nbsp; 
			I don't believe we've had rainfall in months.&nbsp; That leaves the 
			state absolutely dried up, though that has no meaning on the yearly 
			'works.&nbsp; Speaking of rainfall, most habitants here are 
			patiently waiting for the annual monsoon storms.&nbsp; I snapped 
			this picture in late May, and had the false hope that we might begin 
			receiving the storms two months early:</font></p>
			<p><a href="pics/IMG_0889.JPG">
			<font color="#000000">
			<img border="2" src="pics/IMG_0889_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="IMG_0889.JPG" hspace="15" align="right" vspace="11"></font></a></p>
			<p><font color="#000000">Yes, I know the picture would have been immensely better had 
			those cell towers not been smack in the middle, but that's the way 
			it is living in the city.&nbsp; I was quite disappointed to find 
			those towers so close to our little community of houses.</font></p>
			<p><font color="#000000">I digress.&nbsp; Ever since I moved to 
			Arizona in 1990, all forms of fireworks have been illegal.&nbsp; Oh, 
			we'll see some tonight, brought to you by some large display by the 
			city of Surprise, but you know it's never the same.&nbsp; There's 
			something about lighting that fuse and getting the heck out of 
			dodge.&nbsp; I take heart knowing that other states have not banned 
			the art of colorful gunpowder just yet; it means that if we ever do 
			move from this state someday, we may just be able to enact our own 
			glorious display of pyrotechnic delight. </font></p>
			<p><font color="#000000"><b>As you may </b>have noticed, I did 
			manage to fix this page so that it behaves half-way normal.&nbsp; 
			The clickable calendar has been destroyed, however; the thing was 
			too hard to manage.&nbsp; Whenever I moved it, it would blow up the 
			entire table, both where I moved to it, and where I moved it from .&nbsp; 
			Everything else is up to date, and the remaining structure will stay 
			from here on out (or until I get bored again).&nbsp; The only item 
			that might change is the top graphic, as I have always felt the blog 
			page needed its own flair.&nbsp; Agreed?&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font color="#000000">There have also been further posts over at 
			the <a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/">Moblah'g</a>, so if you 
			haven't visited in a while, go check it out.&nbsp; I'll always be 
			grateful for the patronage.&nbsp; I have noticed that the pictures I 
			have taken with the mobile phone always lean heavily toward yellow; 
			it makes me pine greatly for a better camera.&nbsp; Not a new phone, 
			mind you...I'd be happy with an auto-focusing 2 or 3 megapixel 
			camera in my current phone.&nbsp; BUt have I told you of the picture 
			quality of the pictures from the iPhone?&nbsp; Ah, the pictures I 
			could take with that!&nbsp; *back to reality* But that will not 
			happen, as I couldn't do 75% of the other things necessary for the 
			livelihood of the Moblah'g.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font color="#000000">Eh, it is what it is, so for the immediate 
			future, the mobile blog will have yellowish pictures.&nbsp; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font color="#000000"><b>That's it for me </b>today.&nbsp; I 
			think I've neglected my son for long enough this morning, and I 
			haven't yet eaten breakfast.&nbsp; But I've accomplished what I set 
			out to do, and I can relax for the remainder of the day.&nbsp; See 
			you at the <a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/">Moblah'g</a>!</font></p>

			<b>07/02/2007</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>This past weekend was </b>one of those that 
			passed quickly.&nbsp; For example, when Sunday night rolls around, you tend you 
			ask yourself what you accomplished, and the only thing you can think 
			of is eating mac and cheese for dinner.&nbsp; Sure, there was other 
			stuff, but that was all filler, right?</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Of course, I did create quite a few entries 
			for the ol' Moblah'g on Saturday, which was a lot of fun.&nbsp; The 
			boy and I decided we had enough of lounging around the house that 
			morning, and skipped out at around quarter to noon.&nbsp; I'll 
			openly admit that I couldn't face the iPhone's launch sitting down; 
			I had to see it for myself.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/and.html">Like I 
			mentioned</a> in a previous post, I'm mostly impressed with the 
			quality of the gadget.&nbsp; The software is great too, with the 
			exception of that darn keyboard.&nbsp; Most say that it is something 
			that can be gotten used to, I say I may not ever want to.&nbsp; I 
			like the keyboard on my Treo fine, thank you kindly.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Mobile blogging is truly a blast though, even 
			if no one hardly reads it on the weekend.&nbsp; I wish I could go 
			all over the place and do it for a living.&nbsp; I'd do it tomorrow, 
			except my family needs food more than words.&nbsp; Oh, if only these 
			words could earn money.&nbsp; Someday, maybe.&nbsp; Today?&nbsp; Not 
			a chance.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>I often wonder </b>what Sumner thinks of 
			all the time I spend here in my office.&nbsp; He's only a lad of 
			three, so he probably doesn't think much of it.&nbsp; Lately much of 
			my free time has been consumed by the Web site, as happens from time 
			to time...and occasionally he'll saunter in and ask me a few 
			questions about why my Web site is blue (see, he has a supposed 
			monopoly on all things blue, especially dark blue) and afterward, 
			wander back into his room to play trucks or ninja turtles.&nbsp; Oh, 
			and that's another thing entirely.&nbsp; Since when does my 
			offspring play with my number one favorite toy of all time?&nbsp; It 
			just doesn't seem like that long has transpired since I bought my 
			first turtle from Fred and Meyers back in '87.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Ah, but I gave myself away, didn't I?&nbsp; It 
			was a long, long time ago.&nbsp; Nearly 20 years, to my count.&nbsp; 
			The world was so much the same, but so much is different now.&nbsp; 
			If you take time to consider it though, it's overwhelming how much 
			is comparable from a certain perspective.&nbsp; It really provides a 
			bit of comfort in this insanely fast paced world. </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Excuse me.&nbsp; It's 11:00pm and my son just 
			hopped out of bed, and is playing with something on his bedroom 
			floor.</font></p>
			<p>
			<b>No sweat, I'm back.<font color="#000000">&nbsp; </font></b>
			<font color="#000000">I opened the door and a small shadow flew past 
			my field of view and dove back into the bed, dashing under the 
			covers in the hopes that I may not have seen him.&nbsp; It was 
			amusing to behold, because I did the same thing so many times when I 
			was his age.&nbsp; Does nothing change with children?&nbsp; It 
			scares me what things in the future he will try to get away with 
			while I'm not looking.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">I tucked him back into bed and told him that 
			he had a big day ahead of him tomorrow, so he had better get a good 
			night sleep.&nbsp; He asked me if sleeping well would make him be a 
			good boy, and I confirmed that he was already a very good boy, but 
			sleeping would make him even better.&nbsp; He smiled cheekily and 
			with a wink told me that I was a good boy too.&nbsp; Simple moments 
			like those are what make Monday through Friday bearable, my friends.&nbsp; 
			Only a family can do that for you.</font></p>
			<p>
			<img border="5" src="pics/harryconnnick.jpg" width="214" height="214" align="left" hspace="15"><font color="#000000"><b>What am I listening to</b> right now?&nbsp; 
			It's actually one of the finest albums I own.&nbsp; A definite 
			favorite.&nbsp; Highly recommended!&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">When you're tired of listening to traditional 
			children's music, the kind that repeats itself straight into your 
			cerebellum and travels down your spinal cord until it buries 
			yourself deep in your soul, then you'll welcome &quot;Songs I Heard&quot; with 
			tears of overwhelming joy.&nbsp; I could listen to this album for 
			hours, and I have on more than one occasion.&nbsp; Heck, I owned it 
			well before I had Sumner and even before I married the Mrs.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">The selections from &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate 
			Factory&quot; are my absolute favorite.&nbsp; It makes me realize that it 
			was the music (and Gene Wilder, of course) that made that movie.&nbsp; 
			The new version with poor hapless Johnny Depp just doesn't do it for 
			me, I'm afraid.&nbsp; It's visual, sure...but it lacks that special 
			quality and charm that the original was blessed with.&nbsp; The 
			first time I watched the Gene version was back in the early 
			eighties, at my great-grandmother's funeral.&nbsp; All of the 
			parents placed the children under the watchful eyes of the 
			television set while they enjoyed Jell-O with bananas embedded deep 
			into its core.&nbsp; Yes, those are RD's memories.&nbsp; It's 
			probably very, very false...but I was Sumner's age, I think.&nbsp; 
			And the Oompa Loompas scared me to tears.&nbsp; Big surprise.&nbsp; 
			The sky is also blue and the sun is hot.&nbsp; Johnny Depp is also a 
			loon.&nbsp; Just as obvious, to me.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>I have no </b>idea why this blog's column 
			is so insanely long, and I keep taking time out during writing to 
			try and figure it out.&nbsp; I've decided that's not a good idea, as 
			I feel about 10 feet above the keyboard.&nbsp; I'm hitting the 
			backspace button about as many times as I did when I used the 
			iPhone's virtual keyboard (zing!).&nbsp; Probably time for me to 
			head off to bed.&nbsp; Enjoy your Monday!&nbsp; More bloggage at the
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com">Moblah'g</a>.&nbsp; I'll see 
			you there!</font></p>
