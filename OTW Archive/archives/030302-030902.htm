				Too many breaks between writings...<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">It's amazing how time consuming a website 
				can become. It can take over entire evenings with little effort; 
				midnight rolls around rather quickly as you try to rework your 
				tables and make your site cooperate the way you wish it would. 
				Even a small site like mine can be a great distraction, as i 
				haven't had the desire to write any entries. Today, no more 
				meaningless talk about the change of the site, that's done. 
				Complete. Whammo. The magic that was the transition has worked 
				its way into the event horizon of the web. This week: McDonald's 
				actually can be sued for a good reason, Trip to California, and 
				other delightful jewels.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">As i often listen to the radio 
				personalities in the morning, i do hear a great deal of junk 
				stories. The other day i heard that there was a class action 
				lawsuit being brought against McDonalds in Great Britain. 
				Apparently over 30 people have suffered &quot;serious burns&quot; due the 
				the scalding hot nature of McDonald's coffee. Their lawyer, Mr. 
				I.B Jackass, says that the warning on the tops and sides of the 
				coffee cups are insufficient and misleading. That's true, 
				because sometimes you can mistake &quot;Warning: Extremely Hot!&quot; for 
				&quot;Hey, this may be warm, but put it in your lap anyways and burn 
				your procreative powers away&quot;. Needless to say, this is 
				ridiculous and while i feel for any person that was burned by 
				McDonalds hot black nonsense, the lawsuits are probably going to 
				be ignored. Then Tuesday happened to me...<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">I went to the McDonalds on 7th Street and 
				Bell. I was in the vicinity because of a delivery for work, and 
				i knew that this certain location accepted debit cards so i went 
				there. As it ended up, the terminal by the register was broken, 
				so the young lady behind the counter asked me to step into the 
				kitchen itself and use the one for the drive thru. Not really 
				giving this a second thought, i passed by the hot oil and the 
				grills on the way to the terminal. While i was walking back, 
				however, i slipped on a spot of grease beside the grill, and 
				nearly placed my left hand on top of it. Close call. For them.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">Yes, i was stupid enough to walk back 
				there. And i probably wouldn’t have done anything anyway, i 
				gladly confess that i'm not one of the sue happy in this 
				society. But it's just too bad that companies like McDonalds are 
				taken advantage of by clueless consumers that have delusions 
				that they have somehow, in someway, been taken advantage of. 
				People just believe what they want to believe.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">Anyway, my point was lost somewhere 
				amidst all of that writing. If you found one, great! But i 
				wouldn't peruse much longer. Tomorrow, i leave to California for 
				a couple of days. I'll be sure and post as many pictures as 
				possible and write about the great adventures that surely await 
				me in the land of so much style and very little substance. As i 
				don't think i'll have much time to post this weekend, i wish you 
				all a safe and happy weekend.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">Make sure to check the media portion of 
				my site next week..... Tchau.<br>

				I think i've finally turned the corner with the site now.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">It's about 1:30 in the morning, i'm still 
				awake, i have no idea why, but i wanted to post a blog after my 
				successul revamp of <i>Outsidetheworld.com</i>. Already this 
				weekend has flown by, i'll try my hardest to make Sunday last as 
				long as possible. Earlier today, (Saturday) i helped paint my 
				co-workers house. It wasn't a big deal, kind of fun really, but 
				the wind was tenacious and didn't give us a moment's rest. Paint 
				was flying everywhere, and it seemed to try its hardest to blow 
				me off the ladder whenever i was in a precarious position.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">The rest of the day was spent glued to my 
				computer screen, trying to figure out just how to use Microsoft 
				Frontpage. Go figure.<br>
				&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Tahoma">May your weekend last longer than mine!<br>
