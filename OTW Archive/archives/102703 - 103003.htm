			<p>Wife and I appear to be coming down with something.&nbsp; Alas, 
			straight to bed.</p>

			No time to really write, I'm afraid.&nbsp; Since yesterday was my 
			four month anniversary, I had more important things to attend to.&nbsp; 
			See you tomorrow!</p>

			<p>Four months!&nbsp; 06/28/03 - 10/28/03!</p>
			<p>Happy anniversary, sweetie.&nbsp; I love you!</p>
			<p>You've made me the happiest man alive.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Today was much of the same at work, except we decided to help our 
			San Diego because of all of the
			<a href="http://msnbc.com/news/983543.asp?0cv=CA01">fires</a>.&nbsp; 
			I genuinely feel badly for the folks who have lost their homes, but 
			I do not feel an ounce of remorse for those poor souls who complain 
			that they can't have their cable installed because the technician 
			can't drive <br>
			through a wall of flame.&nbsp; Pity.&nbsp; I felt the same way about 
			those in North Carolina who expected our technicians to drive 
			through the swelling ocean to get to their boat, er, home.</p>
			<p>Remember back in 198x, as kids, we would sit in front of the 
			television and watch our wonderful Saturday morning cartoons?&nbsp; 
			Mind you, this was before the era of Japanese animation, so Saturday 
			morning was a little <br>
			more tolerable.&nbsp; So, during these cartoons, we kids would 
			anticipate the strangest commercials.&nbsp; I had one brought back 
			to me the other day:</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Don't drown your food! In mayo or ketchup or 
			goo (yuck!) <br>
			It's no fun to eat what you can't even SEE! So don't drown your 
			food!&quot;</p>
			<p>Now that I'm an adult, and I'm overly cynical about a few more 
			things, I have to wonder what the purpose of that commercial was.&nbsp; 
			As far as I remember, it was <br>
			a little potato or scrap of some non-edible drawing, dancing around 
			singing how we shouldn't sauce our vegetables.&nbsp; Hmmmm....I 
			doubt the severity of that particular dilemma of society.</p>
			<p>I suppose the FDA or some hoo haw might have seen an epidemic 
			striking the children of America that I didn't see.&nbsp; Perhaps 
			tens of thousands of elementary school children would perform a 
			daily ritual of pouring 96 ounces of Heinz 57 sauce all over their 
			goods each lunch time, crying prayers of sacrifice to the gods of 
			white bread and cheese. </p>
			<p>Or, perhaps even more believable, the network execs needed to 
			fill a couple of extra 30 second time slots, and this commercial 
			(and others like it) fulfilled the requirement for educational 
			programming in the mornings.</p>
			<p>Phew, that was a long drawn out piece about nothing.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>In other news, Kobe Bryant was a little miffed yesterday about a 
			few of Shaq's comments, which he directed solely at the Wonder Boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>Kobe lashed back by stating,&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/985536.asp?0dm=C11US">&quot;He is not 
			my quote unquote ‘big brother,’ &quot;</a>&nbsp; All that I have to say 
			is that Kobe better mind his manners.&nbsp; Perhaps all Mr. Bryant 
			needed back in July was a &quot;big brother&quot; to tell him to keep his 
			hands to himself, and his adultery to a minimum.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Poor guy.&nbsp; Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow, and hopefully my 
			writing will be more coherent and entertaining.&nbsp; </p>

			Welcome to a new week of blogginess.&nbsp; (I created a word, today 
			hey hey)</p>
			<p>
			It looks like the site is in full swing now.&nbsp; With a little bit 
			of luck, I hope to have a little bit of business flow from this.&nbsp; 
			This weekend, Wife and I had more free time to ourselves than usual, 
			so we hit the favorite spots.&nbsp; Olive Garden, Hungry Howies, and 
			of course, Best Buy.</p>
			<p>
			My wife is a dear.&nbsp; And when I say a dear, I am trying to 
			illustrate that she is the most thoughtful, kind, and loving person 
			I know.&nbsp; This short story must begin with the understanding 
			that my cell phone was in dire straits.&nbsp; Utter despair, I mean, 
			for crying out loud, the last legs of cell-phone-ness.</p>
			<p>
			So on Saturday night, the last straw.&nbsp; My charger broke while 
			it was still in the cell phone.&nbsp; Thing weren't really going 
			smoothly for me that night anyway, I had tried using the barbeque 
			outside of my apartment for the first time, and I couldn't figure 
			out the blasted starting mechanism.&nbsp; No matter, inside the 
			house I went with the meat.&nbsp; Wife suggested we use the George 
			Foreman grill.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Once bite was enough for me.&nbsp; It tasted like burnt ashes.&nbsp; 
			Oh, there were a few other happenings&nbsp; that went totally awry, 
			but we don't need to go into them.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the 
			cell phone incident placed me firmly over the edge.</p>
			<p>
			My wife decided, spur of the moment, to take me to Best Buy (my 
			favorite store!) and get me a brand new cell phone.&nbsp; This was 
			the one that I had been craving for the longest time.&nbsp; So here 
			it is, and now, I share with you a picture of my cat, courtesy of my 
			nifty camera phone.</p>
