			<b>06/10/2007</b></p>
			<p>
			<b>The rest of the family is </b>asleep at the moment, and that's 
			quite an accomplishment.&nbsp; We've had a terrible time getting 
			Sumner to sleep over the past few days; in fact, I can hardly 
			remember a time when he acted this crazy.&nbsp; He was barking mad 
			last night, I was afraid he'd lose his mind, hez was so tired.&nbsp; 
			Wife and I both made a special mental note to try extra hard today.</p>
			<p>
			Again, he's asleep now, for which I am grateful.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			For this week's entry, I wanted to report on how Sumner did in 
			school.&nbsp; Well, he did just fine.&nbsp; Really great. In fact, 
			I'm pretty sure he saved all his naughtiness for the weekend with 
			his folks.&nbsp; That's fine, better here in a controlled situation.</p>
			<p>
			<b>We had an interesting day </b>yesterday.&nbsp; As the sun was 
			setting and dusk was establishing its mighty grip on the streets 
			around us, the nightly rounds of ATV rides begun.&nbsp; These things 
			are ghastly, noisy beasts, and I have been of the mindset to walk 
			outside and ask them if they could knock it the frack off on more 
			than one occasion.&nbsp; But I've held my tongue.&nbsp; Thank 
			goodness I haven't entered the &quot;get off my lawn&quot; phase of my life.&nbsp; 
			Hopefully never.</p>
			<p>
			Back and forth they rode, quiet Quiet QUIET loud Loud LOUD RaCkEt 
			QUIET quiet gone.&nbsp; Rinse, repeat.&nbsp; My blood was beginning 
			to boil, and that sensitive spot right above my eye?&nbsp; 
			Twitching.&nbsp; Like the alarm clock on Peter Pan.&nbsp; Tick Tock 
			Tick Tock Tick Tock.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Eventually it became as background noise, and I was impervious to 
			its effect.&nbsp; Oh, it was still there, but I was one resigned 
			man, sitting inside his resigned house with his resigned family.&nbsp; 
			This would go on for weeks, it seemed now.&nbsp; At least until they 
			lost their enthusiasm for the ATV.</p>
			<p>
			*SMACK* rumble rumble rumble</p>
			<p>
			I hardly made a move, but the wife darted up from the couch and 
			said, &quot;Did they just hit our house?&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;No, they couldn't have&quot;, said I.&nbsp; My house isn't on the corner 
			of the street, and we're surrounded by at least 10 feet of rock on 
			both sides.&nbsp; We're safe.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;I'm gonna go check it out&quot;, said the wife.&nbsp; By this time, I 
			was out the side door of the house.&nbsp; My wife arrived through 
			the garage at the same time.</p>
			<p>
			She called it.&nbsp; They ran straight into our house.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			It's hard to recall what emotion I was feeling at this point.&nbsp; 
			Until this moment in my life, I had experienced some pretty bad 
			stuff, car accidents, lost jobs, health issues, all with their 
			accompanying emotions.&nbsp; But this was different.&nbsp; I was 
			toying with the idea that it might be good to get mad.&nbsp; So I 
			did.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;I'm really sorry about your house&quot;, said my neighbor.&nbsp; I 
			mentioned something like sorry wasn't going to cut it, and 
			immediately regretted it.&nbsp; Because at that moment, I saw the 
			driver of the ATV.</p>
			<p>
			And then I saw his leg.</p>
			<p>
			His leg hit the house first, not the ATV.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; 
			The force from the 40mph collision was absorbed by the single right 
			leg of this gentleman.&nbsp; The ATV came afterward.</p>
			<p>
			His lower leg was almost off.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Wife went to 
			get ice.&nbsp; I went to get bandages.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			&quot;I don't think it's broken&quot;, said the young man.&nbsp; &quot;If it were, 
			I'd be crying, right?&quot; </p>
			<p>
			&quot;Um, you just sit there.&nbsp; I'll be right back.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			As I ran up the stairs, I thought about my initial reaction to the 
			scene.&nbsp; Why had I gotten so mad?&nbsp; It was just a house, 
			which could easily be repaired.&nbsp; This young man could have lost 
			his leg or his life.&nbsp; I didn't even think to look around for 
			injuries.</p>
			<p>
			I felt like a jackass, and I deserved it.</p>
			<p>
			I ran back outside and everyone was still there, and the leg looked 
			much worse by now.&nbsp; My neighbor proceeded to tell me to send 
			him a bill for my house repairs.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I turned to him and pleaded with him to please forget the house for 
			now.&nbsp; I apologized for overreacting, and begged him to get his 
			friend to a hospital.&nbsp; He delayed further, which deepened my 
			emotional despair.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Eventually, they got him back to the house, and the family and I 
			walked back into ours, amazed at what just transpired.&nbsp; I 
			fiddled around for a few minutes, trying to rationalize my reaction 
			within my own mind, when my wife decided to jump into the foray.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			She mentioned that I didn't see the poor kid at first, and that 
			anyone would be upset when such a large chunk of their house was 
			missing.&nbsp; Fine, but I still feel bad.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			She mentioned that I didn't raise my voice, and that I didn't sound 
			mad.&nbsp; Fine, but I remained steadfastly troubled.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			With nothing else to do, I went back upstairs to my medicine cabinet 
			and, remembering the traumatic experience when I shattered my own 
			knee, retrieved a few of the remaining narcotics that I had left.&nbsp; 
			Not likely they'd accept them, but if anyone needed them at this 
			time, it was this young man.</p>
			<p>
			You see, he was from Mexico, and most likely had no insurance.&nbsp; 
			I had no idea when they'd even get them to the hospital.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I walked over to their house, knocked firmly but warmly on the door, 
			and spoke to my neighbor again.&nbsp; The first thing he said was 
			that he already found someone to fix the side of my house.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Yep, there was that guilty pang again, right on queue.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I shrugged his comments aside, asking him how his friend was, and 
			offering the medicine at the same time.&nbsp; He accepted it, and at 
			the same time informed me that they were going to the Urgent Care as 
			soon as they could.&nbsp; I breathed a sigh of relief, apologized 
			one last time for my reaction, and bid him good evening.</p>
			<p>
			Later that evening, I was talking about the experience again with my 
			wife.&nbsp; She was her usual compassionate self, gently scratching 
			my back and speaking her words of kindness.&nbsp; She said that she 
			knew one of the reasons why I took the medicine over there was to 
			make sure the kid was alright.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			But the truth is, I only wanted one more chance to apologize for the 
			way I reacted.&nbsp; The medicine, while convenient and needed, was 
			merely a mechanism for delivery.</p>
			<p>
			I think I learned my lesson this weekend.&nbsp; </p>
