			<p>Ok, since I didn't post on Thursday, I'll give you all a special 
			treat.&nbsp; It's more than a weekend edition of the Blog, oh yes.</p>
			<p>It's my first song.</p>
			<p>It may only be :57 seconds long, it may not be composed of the 
			greatest sounds.&nbsp; And it just may beat into your head like a 
			bag of hammers.</p>
			<p><a href="../images/gb1.wma">But here it is.&nbsp; Enjoy!</a></p>

			<p><b>
			<font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">11/21/03</font></b></p>
			<p>Sorry about yesterday...</p>
			<p>I was preparing to write last nights' entry, when all of a 
			sudden, *poof* the power went out.&nbsp; It was an incredibly eerie 
			feeling; we've never seen it that dark at our apartment.&nbsp; Even 
			when all of our lights were out, we always had the lamps outside 
			shining through our windows.</p>
			<p>As the lights went dark, several hoots and hollers were heard 
			from the adjacent apartment buildings.&nbsp; I looked outside, 
			alarmed.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, it's just the neighbor boys!&quot;, I said.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I now know that a power failure must be an invitation for young 
			men to begin acting like loons.</p>
			<p>At least 10 of them ended up jumping in the neighboring pool.&nbsp; 
			When they realized that, &quot;Hey, it's just a power outage, and we're
			<i>cold</i>&quot;, they finally shut up and got out.</p>
			<p>So the rest of the evening was spent in stillness and 
			candlelight.&nbsp; Wife and I played cards, well, we played &quot;Go 
			Fish&quot; to be specific.&nbsp; Go Fish is now Wife's favorite game to 
			play with me.&nbsp; Did I mention that she's never won?&nbsp; But 
			it's her favorite game.</p>
			<p>Oh yeah.&nbsp; Dobby completely wrecked our Christmas tree two 
			nights ago.&nbsp; He decided that it was his new play thing, so he 
			climbed through and through.</p>
			<p>What was left was not pretty.</p>
			<p>So, he's on my bad list at the moment.&nbsp; And he knows it, 
			too.&nbsp; He sulks around the house, occasionally glancing up at 
			me, begging to see a glimmer of recognition that he's a good kitty.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			But every time, I give him the look that makes him understand that 
			he's in the dog house.&nbsp; Pardon my language.</p>
			<p>And such is life for us.&nbsp; I hope that you've enjoyed 
			tonight's entry.&nbsp; But now, I must ask a favor of you.&nbsp; If 
			anyone knows of a good software program that will let me create my 
			own MP3 songs, please let me know.&nbsp; (Make sure that it's under 
			$100.00) </p>
			<p>Ah, a good excuse for you to <a href="../contactus.htm">Contact me</a>.</p>

			<p>Ok, not so tired today.</p>
			<p>But I have a surprise for you:</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="../pics/tree.jpg" width="226" height="187"></p>
			<p>The wife persuaded me (like it took much effort) to decorate the 
			Christmas tree this evening.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>So, we're a little early.&nbsp; I can think of a few friends 
			(ahem, Eric?) that would be less than pleased with my premature 
			celebration of Navidad.&nbsp; That's ok, old boy.&nbsp; There's only 
			36 days left.</p>

			<p>Tired.</p>
			<p>I'm sorry.&nbsp; I can't really think straight tonight.&nbsp; I'm 
			mind numbingly drained today.&nbsp; I had big plans for my site, I 
			was really going to go to town on a few pages.&nbsp; But the minute 
			hand paced by quicker than my will, and that will definitely take 
			its toll on my ol' blog.</p>
			<p>At least it's not a one-word entry, because I was going to simply 
			leave it at the first line.</p>
			<p>News:&nbsp; Sting announced his new Tour.&nbsp; Three minutes 
			later, the site went down.&nbsp; But for some reason, I doubt that 
			it was because of a flood of traffic.&nbsp; Rather, I suspect a very 
			poorly designed Web site and an e-mail newsletter that was sent out 
			prematurely.&nbsp; <a href="../pics/sting.jpg">Hmm</a>.&nbsp; So as of 
			9:01pm, I still have no clue of when Sting is to perform here in 
			Arizona.</p>
			<p>In other news:&nbsp; Strong Bad has finally put my feelings into
			<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail89.html">song</a>.</p>
			<p>Sheesh. I just read <a href="http://www.lileks.com/">James 
			Lileks'</a> entry for today, and it appears to be a two parter.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/index.html">More tomorrow!</a>&nbsp; 
			What I would give to have enough verbiage for a decent one-parter.&nbsp; 
			But that's ok; my brother assures me that I should be there someday.&nbsp; 
			And I trust him, because I've trusted him before and it hasn't 
			gotten me into too much trouble.</p>
			<p>That's it for today, I'm afraid.&nbsp; Sorry to disappoint.&nbsp; 
			But I'll be back tomorrow, and hopefully eight hours of sleep 
			richer.</p>

			<p>Darn it.</p>
			<p>I was going to provide you with yet another amusing Sunday 
			picture of Dobby, but apparently, my cell phone provider has 
			black-balled me.&nbsp; Access denied.&nbsp; How humiliating.</p>
			<p>My wife is in the other room watching &quot;boy TV&quot;.&nbsp; It's not 
			any particular show, rather, a type of show.&nbsp; I believe the one 
			she is watching now is called &quot;Maximum Exposure&quot;.&nbsp; You know the 
			type.&nbsp; It's basically Cops.&nbsp; Boy TV is anything with stuff 
			caught on tape.&nbsp; Car crashes, hostage situations, people's 
			trousers falling south in public, etc.</p>
			<p>So, why is my wife watching it?&nbsp; Cause she's cute.&nbsp; Why 
			else?</p>
			<p>It was quite the uneventful weekend, but I think some of you may 
			have realized what I learned how to do:&nbsp; I made a pop-up 
			advertisement appear on my Web site.&nbsp; Yes, I have joined the 
			unholy ranks of the annoying.&nbsp; Can you blame me?&nbsp; Not many 
			have decided to ask for a free e-mail address, and I simply wanted 
			to ensure that I had my fair warning out there.</p>
			<p>Wife and I decided to alter our choice of grocery stores this 
			time around.&nbsp; We've been stuck on Albertsons for the past 
			couple of months, and truthfully, we haven't been fond of their 
			selection.&nbsp; So, we ventured over to Fry's, and were more than 
			pleased.&nbsp; As my Wife put it, there's enough of any one thing to 
			find at least something you need on sale.&nbsp; And that's the 
			truth.</p>
			<p>And what made me happy was they let me bag my own groceries.&nbsp; 
			Ok, ok, they didn't have a bagger and probably wanted me to bag 'em.&nbsp; 
			But when I went to &lt;unnamed store&gt; last time, the bagger actually 
			snarled and informed me that he could lose his job (or some 
			nonsense) if I helped him bag.&nbsp; I thought he was kidding, and 
			continued bagging contently.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&quot;No, really.&nbsp; I can get in trouble if you keep doing that.&quot; 
			said Unhappy Bagger Boy.</p>
			<p>Oooook.&nbsp; Sure.</p>
			<p>Long story short, I like to bag my own groceries.&nbsp; 
			Especially since they put my bleach in the same bag as my eggs.&nbsp; 
			Really smooth.</p>
			<p>Alright.&nbsp; That's done.&nbsp; Off to bed, more later this 
			week.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
