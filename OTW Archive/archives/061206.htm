			<td width="477" height="336" align="left" valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/divider.gif" width="477" height="5"><p>
			<font color="#003366"><b>06/12/06</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>Stay a while, I wish </b>to tell you a 
			story.&nbsp; It's not a long story, but it is filled with happiness, 
			embarrassment, laughter, disappointment, steak, and 150 miles of 
			driving.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">First, the situation demands that I set the 
			scene for you.&nbsp; Allow me to elucidate.&nbsp; My brother in law 
			is departing for college in less than a week, which gave us this 
			weekend as the last opportunity to go on a long awaited campout.&nbsp; 
			He and I don't deviate from the norm; we go to the same place each 
			time.&nbsp; Saves time and effort, see, we're too lazy to find 
			anyplace else and heaven knows if they have a place to cook steak.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Which, I might add, is the sole reason for 
			going on these adventures.&nbsp; Steak hardly tastes better than 
			when it's cooked over a fire.&nbsp; And if dirt or charcoal happens 
			to intrude upon it's seared precipice, so be it.&nbsp; I will never 
			turn down a steak cooked while camping.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Being the zealous campers (and grillers) that 
			we are, we wanted to be prepared for a full evening.&nbsp; We called 
			upon two other friends to accompany us for the weekend trip.&nbsp; 
			Daniel and Andy are their names, they need no further introduction 
			(as they will become integral parts of the story further below).</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Daniel agreed that he would obtain the steak 
			necessary for the campout.&nbsp; Seeing that I worked until 6pm on 
			Friday, I would have very little time to actually purchase anything.&nbsp; 
			However, I digress.&nbsp; I did seek out the necessary firewood 
			earlier that day during my lunch break.&nbsp; As I related to each 
			of them later that day, when I asked the friendly Home Depot 
			representatives whether I might obtain firewood at that location, 
			they proceeded to circle me about in raucous laughter.&nbsp; I 
			happened to be wearing a t-shirt that said &quot;Albany&quot;, so one of the 
			workers supposed I was from New York, and didn't know any better. I 
			let him believe that supposition.&nbsp; It was great until he said 
			he was from there as well, and wondered what part I lived in.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Yes, it was 109 degrees outside that day.&nbsp; 
			But, I still needed the firewood.&nbsp; Not happening at Home Depot, 
			I left, tail between my legs.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Anyway, where was I?&nbsp; Ah yes, Daniel 
			purchased the needed steak for me, and I was ever so grateful.&nbsp; 
			Silly me also forgot to tell my brother in law, Matt, that Daniel 
			had agreed to get the steak.&nbsp; So, of course, we had a double 
			helping of steak for our journey.&nbsp; How much steak could we have 
			possibly brought, you ask?</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Nine pounds.&nbsp; Count it.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">That was roughly 28 ounces per person.&nbsp; 
			Two and a half pounds, or so.&nbsp; Give or take some ounces.&nbsp; 
			My math, she is no good, see?</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Let's just allay any false pretenses and 
			resolve to be honest, here.&nbsp; Nothing went right during this 
			entire campout.&nbsp; In fact, I would not even call it a campout.&nbsp; 
			Here's why.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">We were all to pick up my brother in law on 
			the way to the campsite, seeing as how he lived on the opposite end 
			of the Valley than us.&nbsp; We just figured it would save time.&nbsp; 
			That was what we thought, at least.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">I asked him to meet us at the Wendy's 
			restaurant at Pima Road and the 101 freeway.&nbsp; When we got 
			there, we noticed that there was, in fact, no Wendy's, so we 
			proceeded three miles north to determine if it was slightly out of 
			our way.&nbsp; Nothing there.&nbsp; We called him back, and to make 
			(this story) short(er), we figured out that there was not one Pima 
			exit, but two Pima exits, and he was at the one nearly 15 miles away 
			from us.&nbsp; Undaunted, we sallied forth to that location to 
			obtain the final piece of our four-person puzzle.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">By now, it was severe dusk, so we needed to 
			make it to the campsite post-haste.&nbsp; It was a car ride full of 
			laughter and joking, with one of the jokes a passing thought that it 
			would be hilarious if the campsite did not allow fires.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Let me say that it was <b>not</b> hilarious 
			that the campsite did not allow fires.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Wait.&nbsp; Allow me to add further color and 
			context to this matter.&nbsp; The sign actually read &quot;NO FUMAR 
			MADERA&quot;. For those of you who do not speak Spanish, that reads &quot;NO 
			SMOKING WOOD&quot;.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">This was one of those moments when I kept 
			looking back at the sign, hoping to read a different message, or at 
			least an additional message that would give us some hope for the 
			ceremonious grilling of steak.&nbsp; None ever came.&nbsp; I decided 
			to take the point at that point, and turned the car around to head 
			toward Fountain Hills.&nbsp; On the way there, we found another 
			campsite, which was also closed due to the fire hazard.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Can I say that Arizona sucks for camping?&nbsp; 
			Thank you.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Further along in our car ride, we passed 
			through Fountain Hills, chowing down on Lay's potato chips, pork 
			rinds, and Gatorade.&nbsp; None of us wished to stray from our path 
			to venture into the side roads of Fountain Hills to find a park with 
			a grill. Although I did offer the sum of $25.00 to any passenger who 
			would knock on a random door and ask the resident if we could borrow 
			their grill.&nbsp; Andy took me up on that offer, but I chickened 
			out.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">For some reason, we decided to head in the 
			exact opposite direction of where we were headed and drive to Mesa.&nbsp; 
			During this portion of our adventure, Andy began to wane as he lost 
			hope of ever eating (or leaving the car).&nbsp; He saw a sign that 
			said &quot;Cold Stone Creamery&quot; and beckoned to us to head in that 
			direction.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">&quot;That's the corporate office, Andy&quot;, I said.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">&quot;You're telling me you think there's no ice 
			cream there?&quot;, he retorted.&nbsp; At that, the whole of us lost 
			control and began laughing hysterically.&nbsp; If this does not seem 
			funny to you as you read it, it can only be because of the lack of 
			context.&nbsp; In other words, you had to have been there.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">We made it to Mesa in one piece, with several 
			mentions of the fact that we were SO glad that we had nine lbs of 
			meat in our trunk.&nbsp; Actually, the number varied the entire 
			evening, with numbers reaching as high as 983 lbs.&nbsp; It honestly 
			felt like that much meat.&nbsp; The trunk felt like it was laboring 
			my car.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Not to be detered from actually cooking this 
			steak, we fired up Matt's grill in his backyard.&nbsp; The meat that 
			Daniel brought was so large that it did not fit on the grill.&nbsp; 
			I noticed at this point that the steak looked a little...marbled.&nbsp; 
			That's being kind.&nbsp; These cuts had more gristle on them than 
			meat.&nbsp; Faithful that we would be rewarded for our efforts of 
			the evening, I believed the majority of it would be cooked off and 
			we would be left with the tender remains of rib eye greatness.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Each one of us chewed through 27 ounces of 
			fat.&nbsp; There's really nothing else I can say.&nbsp; It was 
			horrifying.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">We each sat on the couch, one by one, utterly 
			dejected at the final product of the nights' travails.&nbsp; I 
			looked over at Daniel, he returned the look and slouched further 
			into the sofa.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">&quot;I'm hungry&quot;, he said.&nbsp; We lost it again.&nbsp; 
			Laughter rung through the house like a choir of recess kids.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">So, we got back in the car again and drove 
			down the road, looking for anything that was still open (it was 
			11:45pm).&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, (and I mean FINALLY) we found a 
			Village Inn that was still open and headed inside.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">The waiter took our orders for breakfast, and 
			we managed to inform him about a portion of our evening.&nbsp; He 
			summed it up quite handily for us when we were finished describing 
			it:</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">&quot;What were you doing with that much meat?&quot;</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Again, the laughter broke through.&nbsp; I 
			looked around the restaurant and saw that the rest of the patrons 
			were rolling their eyes at our antics, but we didn't care.&nbsp; We 
			had one of the most memorable nights in a long time.&nbsp; This 
			relation of this story simply does not do it enough justice.&nbsp; I 
			think we'd all agree that we'd do it again in a heart beat.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Oh, and Daniel:&nbsp; I hear Impact Auto Body 
			is looking for a new &quot;mechanic&quot;.&nbsp; Your attire in the car would 
			be entirely appropriate for the interview that I scheduled for you.</font></p>
