			I just got off the telephone with Sprint.&nbsp; It seems that they 
			managed to foul up <br>
			my billing once again.&nbsp; It wasn't that big of a deal, because I 
			was certain that <br>
			they had made the mistake.&nbsp; But it was a whole lot of money, 
			and Sprint is the <br>
			one company that I choose (I don't know why) to have automatically 
			debited <br>
			from my checking account.</p>
			<p>
			So, the funds are gone until the next billing period.&nbsp; (sound 
			of toilet flushing)</p>
			<p align="center">
			.....</p>
			<p>
			Sorry about that, I finally got fed up with the ominous odor 
			emanating from my kitten's litter box.&nbsp; I lost my train of 
			though.&nbsp; Wait, no, yes.&nbsp; It's gone.</p>
			<p>
			And he just p00ped again.&nbsp; Thanks, fat cat.&nbsp; Gosh.</p>
			<p>
			<b>In other news:&nbsp; </b>So I
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3967179/">found out</a> today 
			that pet stores sell <a href="http://www.glofish.com">glowing fish</a> 
			now.&nbsp; <br>
			Now, allow me to elucidate.&nbsp; I found out that they sell, as 
			pets, genetically <br>
			altered (modified?) fluorescent zebra fish.</p>
			<p>
			These small goldfish look-alikes were originally developed to help 
			scientists <br>
			study pollution levels.&nbsp; However, they are now being 
			mass-marketed in the <br>
			United States (sans California, which banned the sale of these 
			creatures of science) as household pets.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The news part of this is that two public interest groups have filed 
			a lawsuit, alleging that these creations must be regulated by the 
			feds.&nbsp; They claim that <br>
			these fish are unsafe and if released into the wild, could represent 
			a hazard as other animals consume these fish.&nbsp; We humans eat 
			these other animals in turn.</p>
			<p>
			So that's the basic of their argument.&nbsp; Good case, I'd admit.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			All I know is that I want one.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Brother's blog</b>:&nbsp; If you haven't already, you ought to 
			check out my brother's <br>
			<a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net/">Web site.</a>&nbsp; There has 
			been much controversy as of late with this
			<a href="http://bloggenpucky.net/2004_01_01_bloggenpucky_archive.html#107411639261818973">
			particular article</a>, entitled Voluntary Simplicity.&nbsp; If 
			you'd met my brother before, you would understand me when I say that 
			he leads a very simple yet complex lifestyle.&nbsp; He is envied and 
			misunderstood at the same time.&nbsp; People turn to him for advice, 
			yet dole out criticism in stride.&nbsp; His comments on voluntary 
			simplicity are genuine and intelligent, and darned if I agree.</p>
			<p>
			However, I lead a different lifestyle, albeit I admit that it's 
			still strangely complex.&nbsp; Take for instance my story about 
			Sprint that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; I could be without that 
			stress in my life, but I'd imagine that I'd bored with that.</p>
			<p>
			<b>I think a fish hit on my wife</b>.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; We 
			went to The Rainforest Cafe last Saturday.&nbsp; We were seated 
			adjacent quite a large aquarium with various tropical fish.&nbsp; 
			However, there was one fish that couldn't quite keep his eyes off my
			<br>
			beautiful bride.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/casanova.jpg" width="360" height="256"><br>
			He just sat there, staring.</p>
			<p>
			She thought it was creepy, I thought it was quite amusing.&nbsp; And 
			if you're wondering why I had a picture of this particular moment, 
			stop wondering.&nbsp; I take my camera everywhere now.&nbsp; It's 
			the greatest fuel that the Blog has ever had.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
			<p>
			I'm sure there was more, but that'll do for now.&nbsp; To make up 
			for this week's missed entries, I'll be back tomorrow for one more.&nbsp; 
			But don't say I didn't warn you.&nbsp; Go get me a Glofish.</p>

			Only a picture for today.&nbsp; Tonight, my wife and I went to the 
			Suns game, as she had won tickets (I'd probably never pay to see 
			them, unless they were playing the Utah Jazz, in that case, I'd be 
			paying to see the Jazz)&nbsp; The game was ultra-boring, and that's 
			being nice.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/melo.jpg" width="360" height="270"></p>
			<p>
			The only reason that I went was to see number 15.&nbsp; Carmelo 
			Anthony, one of the youngest players ever in the NBA.&nbsp; I wonder 
			how many times we'll say that...eventually, they'll find a way to 
			get a 17 year old in, as long as he's graduated from High School.</p>

			A thousand apologies.&nbsp; In my desire to continue my vacation 
			well into Monday morning, I avoided my computer like month-old milk.</p>
			<p>
			But we're back to the grind now.&nbsp; It's approximately 7:30pm, 
			and I'm late.&nbsp; But fear not, because I have something to show 
			for the delay.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Pictures</b>.&nbsp; Yes, I took that adventure that I had been 
			wanting.&nbsp; I ventured outside my apartment vicinity for what 
			seems like the first time in weeks.&nbsp; I feel like this because 
			in my moments of solitary meditation last week, I continually 
			envisioned the same scenery in my mind over and over.&nbsp; It all 
			consisted of the area surrounding my apartment and work local.</p>
			<p>
			Blah blah.&nbsp; My journey took me to downtown Phoenix, where I 
			photographed the Viad Building and its immediate surroundings.&nbsp; 
			Please let me explain, I haven't had much experience with digital 
			photography, and I've had even less experience with this camera.&nbsp; 
			So, those pictures didn't turn out that great.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			That is, until I visited the botanical gardens east of town.&nbsp; 
			At first, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of variety and poor 
			supply of vivid color on my trek around the jardin.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			But after I took off my durn-blasted sunglasses, which have more 
			scratches than my brother's 45's after I listened to them as a 
			child, I began to see the small bits of color that were strewn about 
			the area.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/favorite.jpg" width="360" height="270"><br>
			My Favorite</p>
			<p>
			I sincerely enjoyed that part of my day.&nbsp; I found it relaxing, 
			invigorating, and educational (although I failed to write down any 
			of the names of the flora)&nbsp; The most amusing part of the garden 
			was the Library.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			This bibliotek was placed adjacent the visitors center, so i stopped 
			there before leaving.&nbsp; I took out my camera and began taking 
			random pictures because I could, when all of a sudden, the librarian 
			came swooping out of the woodwork.</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>I see that you're taking pictures</i>&quot;, she said.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>Er, yes.</i>&quot;, I said, rather startled.&nbsp; &quot;I<i>s that ok?&nbsp; 
			I can stop if you'd like</i>.&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>Oh, no!&nbsp; It's quite alright.&nbsp; Are you a librarian</i>?&quot;, 
			she inquired, excitedly.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>Well, no, but I have an extreme fascination with small 
			libraries.</i>&quot;, I lied.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>Oh, that's absolutely wonderful!&nbsp; Are you from a newspaper?</i>&quot;&nbsp; 
			she said, her left eye twitching wildly.&nbsp; I was beginning to 
			believe she might actually faint at this point.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>No, no...I'm from...I'm from my school in Colorado.&nbsp; I'm 
			taking pictures of small Arizona libraries for my Senior project.</i>&quot;&nbsp; 
			I said.&nbsp; My web of lies was growing faster than my desire to 
			keep the charade up.</p>
			<p>
			&quot;<i>Well, be sure to sign our guest book up front.&nbsp; And feel 
			free to take as many pictures as you please!</i>&quot;&nbsp; she 
			exclaimed, and disappeared as fast as she came.</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			I was relieved that she had decided to end the conversation at that 
			point.&nbsp; I don't know if:</p>
			<p>
			A.&nbsp; I could come up with more falsifications, and<br>
			B.&nbsp; If I could keep from laughing any longer</p>
			<p>
			Since I've gone on long enough about this library, how about the 
			link to these aforementioned pictures?&nbsp; You may find them
			<a href="../journey.htm">here</a>, or you can always find this 
			permanently on my <a href="../photography.htm">Media</a> Page.</p>
			<p>
			And that's it, for I must save more verbiage for later on tonight.&nbsp; 
			I must cook up another blog for those who read late at night or 
			early in the morning.&nbsp; Again, sorry for the delay, and I hope 
			that the pictures make up for it.</p>
			<p>
			Postscript: For a limited time, I will be offering these pictures 
			for download in whatever size you need.&nbsp; Please
