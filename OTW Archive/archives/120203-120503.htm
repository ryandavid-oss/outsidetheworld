			<p>A little late in the day, but still, it's December 5th.</p>
			<p>And since this is probably going to be archived fairly soon, I'd 
			imagine that this particular entry won't be widely read by everyone.&nbsp; 
			So, I suppose that I can write whatever I want, and no one will 
			care!</p>
			<p>It was a <i>busy</i> week.&nbsp; Five days, completely non-stop.&nbsp; 
			From work, to fixing my friend's computers, I don't remember one 
			moment when I wasn't doing something, somewhere.&nbsp; I'm looking 
			forward to tomorrow with great anticipation, as I have absolutely 
			nothing on the agenda.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Ah, time to spare.&nbsp; Maybe a little bit of it will be spent 
			on the Web site, maybe a little on catching up on a little TiVo'd 
			television, probably a little shopping, and a whole lotta nothin'.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I hope that the weekend greets all of you in the same regard. </p>
			<p>If any of you haven't noticed, there's a new page link on this 
			site.&nbsp; It's called Flotsam, and it's where everything that I've 
			already retired is going to wash up.&nbsp; From old graphics to old 
			outdated Web pages, you'll find it in there.&nbsp; For those who 
			have visited this site frequently, you may recognize a few pictures.&nbsp; 
			Warning:&nbsp; Most of the links in those pages are very, very 
			defunct.&nbsp; You'll soon meet Mr. 404 if you wade around those 
			pages for very long.</p>
			<p>In other news:&nbsp; My Wife's second ultrasound is next Tuesday.&nbsp; 
			Mark your calendars, because there will be quite an entry that day.</p>
			<p>Have a great weekend!&nbsp; May yours last as long as mine.</p>
			<p>

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/04/03</font></b></p>
			<p>It's beginning to be quite difficult to come up with enough 
			literature to fill up an entire entry.&nbsp; My job takes up most of 
			the time, and not much happens there anyway.&nbsp; And besides, 
			whatever interesting information I have from that sphere of life 
			can't really be written online, as I could somehow get fired for it.</p>
			<p>Lately, my nights have been taken up, as well.&nbsp; I'd love to 
			sit down for an hour or two and really hammer out some thoughts on 
			life at this moment.&nbsp; I want to paint a vivid picture for any 
			who read this on a diurnal basis.</p>
			<p>But that simply cannot be.&nbsp; I have too much going on, and 
			not enough of it is important enough to mention, really.&nbsp; I 
			expect things to pick up, but that may leave me with less time to 
			write and more time to enjoy what I'm doing.</p>
			<p>Is that a curse?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; It just means that 
			whatever scribble you see here might just be nothing more than what 
			you read tonight.</p>
			<p>An entry for the sake of the blog!&nbsp; Promise kept.&nbsp; See 
			you tomorrow!</p>
			<p>

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/03/03</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma">Guess what?&nbsp; I found Autumn.</font></p>
			<p><img border="0" src="../pics/fall.jpg" width="286" height="236"></p>
			<p>It's residing in this lonely tree, right outside of my apartment 
			complex.&nbsp; I would imagine that this image will be nothing more 
			than ephemeral, as it could be 90 degrees come tomorrow.</p>
			<p>Oh, and for any of you who may have realized my mistake of 
			assumption yesterday, I apologize.&nbsp; Apparently, my spellchecker 
			will pass anything with that may be hyphenated.&nbsp; No, 
			really...watch!</p>
			<p>Zippy-gyro. (no problems!)</p>
			<p>Nike-Reebok.&nbsp; (not an issue!)</p>
			<p>Ryan-David. (nice!)</p>
			<p>Enough of that.&nbsp; I spent another hour at the mall tonight, 
			and I didn't manage to make much head-way.&nbsp; Or maybe I'm simply 
			writing this so that I can mislead my wife into believing that I 
			didn't purchase anything?&nbsp; Hmm, interesting, interesting.&nbsp; 
			Now all she can do is wonder.&nbsp; (or, she could just ask me...I 
			can't lie to that pretty face of hers)</p>
			<p>In other news:&nbsp; Google has finally combed over my site in 
			its entirety.&nbsp; Go ahead, <a href="http://www.google.com/">try 
			it!</a>&nbsp; I'll bet you find plenty of random links you didn't 
			even know existed.&nbsp; Gone are the days of defunct links and 404 
			errors.</p>
			<p>Sorry, that's all I have for December 3rd.&nbsp; I'm tired, been 
			up since 6:00am, and I still need to do the laundry.&nbsp; See you 
			tomorrow!&nbsp; </p>

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/02/03</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma">First of all, you are very lucky. (or 
			unlucky, as the case may be)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma">If I had a digital camera, I'd be following 
			suit of <a href="http://www.lileks.com">James Lileks' site</a> right 
			now.&nbsp; For the entire month of December, he's on hiatus from the 
			Bleat.&nbsp; Instead, he is giving his readers their fill of 
			photographs and other assorted mish-mash.&nbsp; (spell checker didn't find a 
			problem with the word &quot;mish-mash&quot;.&nbsp; Spectacular!)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma">Good news this past weekend:&nbsp; I managed 
			to inflict a major dent in the holiday shopping list.&nbsp; I'd love 
			to give everyone the run-down of everything purchased, however; my 
			wife is an avid reader of my site, and that would ruin all of the 
			fun.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that Target is a blessing and a curse 
			at the same time.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma">To word it very delicately, it simply has 
			everything.&nbsp; I spent two hours at the mall and came up very 
			shorthanded.&nbsp; But just one hour at Target gave me loads of 
			ideas.&nbsp; What a boon!&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>Other good news:&nbsp; The cat is no longer sick.&nbsp; 
			Wait...that really isn't that good of news.&nbsp; Now, instead of 
			sleeping at nights, he runs around our room like a sugar-injected 5 
			year old.&nbsp; He also eats like 78 times per day now, too.&nbsp; I 
			don't want a fat cat...so maybe I should stop feeding him bacon. </p>
			<p>But it wasn't MY fault that he ate the bacon grease.&nbsp; He did
			<i>that</i> of his own volition.</p>
			<p>Hmm....nothing but good news today, I guess.&nbsp; I reckon that 
			I can spice this entry up a bit with a dash of bad 
			news-salty-flavor, but that simply wouldn't be conducive to the 
			Christmas Spirit.</p>
			<p>And if anyone has wondered where the Blog was yesterday, my 
			apologies.&nbsp; The holiday season will probably provide less time 
			for writing, and I fully expect the entries to become a bit more 
			emaciated as the 25th approaches.&nbsp; But I make a promise:&nbsp; 
			No more missed entries.</p>
			<p>So, that's it.&nbsp; See you tomorrow!</p>
