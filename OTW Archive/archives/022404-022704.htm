			<b>Everyone should learn at least one lesson per day</b>, if not 
			more.&nbsp; The lesson for me yesterday was this: never try to learn 
			PHP and implement it into your Web site 30 minutes before you go to 
			bed.&nbsp; If you do, you'll end up with a defunct link and empty 
			promises.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Best Buy</b>.&nbsp; I visited my very favorite store again 
			tonight, Thursdays are very rewarding days because I can take the 
			car wherever I please.&nbsp; I wandered over toward the video games 
			section to check out the new James Bond game.&nbsp; It's supposed to 
			be different because not only does it use the real actor's names, it 
			uses their voices and personage.</p>
			<p>
			The title of this new game is &quot;Everything Or Nothing&quot;.&nbsp; Yeah, 
			that's good, and I suppose that it'll suit the game just nicely.&nbsp; 
			But aren't the titles of Bond movies supposed to be a little more 
			self-defeating?&nbsp; Why not, &quot;Everything <i>Is</i> Nothing&quot;.&nbsp;
			<br>
			Yes, that sounds much better.&nbsp; Ten times more obscurity in that 
			sentence.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>That's it</b> for now.&nbsp; I have mind-numbing fatigue washing 
			over me.&nbsp; See you again tomorrow.</p>
			<p>

			<p>
			<b>I've got</b> Ben Folds playing in the background, the latest beta 
			test is downloading slowly, so let us begin.</p>
			<p>
			I'm not going to beat around the bush.&nbsp; <b>GREATEST COMMERCIAL 
			EVER</b>.</p>
			<p>
			And just what is the greatest commercial, you ask?&nbsp; None other 
			than Quizno's strange spong monkey spots. If you haven't yet viewed 
			these, you may view them both <a href="http://www.quiznos.com">here</a>.&nbsp; 
			The basic premise is fairly standard; these small furry mysteries 
			attempt to get you talking about their commercial.</p>
			<p>
			It begins with one furry creature singing a crazy song about their 
			subs, a bowler hat atop his (her?) head, while their friend is in 
			the upper corner with an 18th century sailor's hat plucking away at 
			a guitar.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Sure, the voice is funny.&nbsp; Yes, the little creatures are&nbsp; 
			amusing.&nbsp; But the greatest part of this commercial, the part 
			that absolutely makes me double over laughing on the floor, it the 
			part where there is a longer pause, followed by the line &quot;They got a 
			pepper bar!&quot;</p>
			<p>
			I don't know what a pepper bar is, I don't really care, but this 
			commercial has me sold.&nbsp; I'm going, first chance I get.</p>
			<p>
			And by the way, just in case you're wondering what a &quot;spong monkey&quot; 
			is, it's a creation from the United Kingdom that appeared on the Net 
			a little while ago and became a pop culture icon there.</p>
			<p>
			And yes, either you love this commercial, or you hate it.&nbsp; But 
			I belong to the former group.&nbsp; I have to give this ad an &quot;A&quot;.&nbsp; 
			I think that they should market a stuffed animal.</p>
			<p>
			<b>In other news</b>:&nbsp; I've decided to do something drastic to 
			get my daily visits up.&nbsp; I haven't decided just what that's 
			going to be, but there's been quite a drop off in visits this month.&nbsp; 
			Sure, I could attribute that to the fact that I haven't been 
			writing, but I'll be naive and just assume that everyone is bored 
			with the same old.</p>
			<p>
			Will it be music?&nbsp; Will it be pictures?&nbsp; A new story?

			<p>
			<b>On a personal note: Happy Birthday, Adam</b>.&nbsp; How does 
			number 35 feel?&nbsp; Much like 34 and 33, I presume?&nbsp; Well, 
			congratulations on making it this far.&nbsp; Six kids, a fantastic 
			wife, and a legacy of fine living.&nbsp; I hope this year marks the 
			beginning of many good things for you.</p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>Hmm... </b>my brother's birthday is here, 
			which means that mine is fast approaching.&nbsp; Nothing is needed, 
			thank you.&nbsp; The discounted car insurance will be fine enough 
			for me.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000"><b>Many things today</b>. In fact, I have so 
			many ideas in my head that I'm debating whether or not to save some 
			of these wonders for another day.&nbsp; You've seen my history 
			lately, so you should understand my desire to space things out, 
			right?&nbsp; Nevertheless, I tread on.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Over the weekend, while visiting my parents 
			house, we broke out the old super 8mm projector.&nbsp; As I have 
			very few baby pictures, my wife really wanted to see what I looked 
			like and this was pretty much the only valid option.&nbsp; It was a 
			little overwhelming at first, when at first I saw the old projector 
			and heard the familiar clicks, I will admit that I was taken back by 
			more than a few years.&nbsp; After wading through 300+ reels and 
			jury-rigging the projector, we managed to view a few of the first 
			moments of my life.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">And I still don't believe that anyone realizes 
			what an impact that this made on me.&nbsp; I had never seem myself 
			like this before, so small and new.&nbsp; It was me, yet it was not.&nbsp; 
			The small personage in the movies who was writhing around and 
			begging for attention did not bring even the slightest bit of 
			remembrance to mind.&nbsp; We viewed reel after reel and I was 
			amazed ever more with each passing moment.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">There we were, my entire family, but so much 
			younger.&nbsp; Like the Wonder Years, I tried to give context to the 
			scene before me, but simply couldn't.&nbsp; Instead, I watched with 
			amazement as I watched my life unfold before my eyes.&nbsp; I viewed 
			myself at only a year old, being woken up in my own crib on my 
			birthday.&nbsp; I seemed happy enough.&nbsp; Then, on to my first 
			attempts at walking.&nbsp; My elder brother, who I spoke of earlier, 
			would hold a blue balloon just out of my grasp, and I would clap and 
			try so hard to grab it.&nbsp; I would fall each time, only to be 
			picked up again by my father, smiling and ready to give it a go all 
			over again.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">I saw myself at eight years old, just before 
			my baptism into the Church.&nbsp; There was a darkened film of my 
			birthday party.&nbsp; The faces only drew brief recognition, as many 
			of their names have long been forgotten.&nbsp; However, one face 
			that I was indeed looking for struck me.&nbsp; My best friend Jimmy, 
			a ghost from the past, was hitting me over the head with my present 
			in some bizarre birthday ritual.&nbsp; In another scene, we were 
			simply talking and laughing about something.&nbsp; It both healed 
			and wounded me so much to see his face again, as I haven't seen him 
			in over seven years.&nbsp; He passed away from leukemia when he was 
			only 17 years old.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">I basically stopped there, because I didn't 
			want emotional overload or because the hour was late, I know not.&nbsp; 
			But it was an experience that I will never forget, and hope to 
			experience again.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">Alrighty, that's enough for today.&nbsp; 
			Surely there will be more tomorrow.&nbsp; Come back for a free 
			prize.&nbsp; OK, I lied.&nbsp; Come back for more blather.&nbsp; But 
			that's always free.</font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#000000">And free is a good thing.</font></p>

			<p>
			<b>32</b>.&nbsp; My favorite number.&nbsp; Karl Malone's jersey 
			number.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The number of weeks that my wife is pregnant.</p>
			<p>
			<b>I keep disappearing</b>.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; Last weekend, 
			I went camping with some buddies of mine.&nbsp; I could tell 
			immediately that this venture wouldn't be the most organized event, 
			but that was A-OK with me, as I'm not much for planning.&nbsp; But 
			we did manage to procure the main necessities for the campout, such 
			as food, water, warm clothes and sleeping bags.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			We also obtained some firewood, as we were going to barbeque our 
			steaks once we got there.&nbsp; We were set, and we took off.&nbsp; 
			When we were about two thirds of the way there, my wife called to 
			check on our status.&nbsp; Seems we also forgot the wood.&nbsp; Doh!</p>
			<p>
			Not a problem, my buddy says.&nbsp; There's a gas station nearby the 
			campsite where we can purchase some more wood.&nbsp; After another 
			10 minutes, we park our car and go into this gas station.</p>
			<p>
			As this station is in a very affluent area of Rio Verde, the place 
			is spotless and the clientele is such that you would not suspect 
			that much firewood is required.&nbsp; The young girl behind the 
			counter, who appears more apt to be found at a Saturday night rave 
			party, mumbles that they have no firewood to speak of.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Harrumph.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			So, off to Walgreens.&nbsp; One more try.&nbsp; Does Walgreens sell 
			firewood?&nbsp; I think we both know the answer to that question.&nbsp; 
			But they do sell duraflame logs!&nbsp; Wonderful, waxy, crackly 
			duraflame logs!</p>
			<p>
			We bought them without so much as a second thought, and pursued our 
			course onward to the campsite.&nbsp; I had the terrible feeling 
			afterward in my head that cooking over saw dust might be bad, but I 
			was with my boys, and no sense acting like the crazy worried married 
			guy.&nbsp; Besides, I had already ruined my tough guy reputation 
			with my ramblings about shopping at DSW and how much fun I had 
			there.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>Wait for the flame to go down</b>.&nbsp; We were a bit hungry.&nbsp; 
			Moreover, we were very impatient.&nbsp; Shortly after the duraflames 
			were lit, we plopped our steaks on the grill.&nbsp; The fire rose 
			steadily to the sky, charring every bit of meat that we had.&nbsp; 
			Lesson learned, and good thing too, because we still had five pounds 
			of meat left.&nbsp; Side note:&nbsp; We also learned that A-1 sauce 
			is the savior of burnt meat.&nbsp; End of story.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Baby</b>.&nbsp; Like I said, 32 weeks along means eight weeks 
			left.&nbsp; Eight small weeks that pass like days.&nbsp; Eight weeks 
			means less than two months.&nbsp; I won't calculate that in days, 
			hours or minutes, as I would probably lose a great deal of apex hair 
			in the process.&nbsp; Time's doing its job well enough in that 
			instance, I'm afraid.</p>
			<p>
			Good night.&nbsp; Time to fold up this parachute.</p>
