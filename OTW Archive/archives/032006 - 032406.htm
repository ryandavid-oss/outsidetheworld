			<p>
			<b>It's no small </b>accomplishment that I'm actually going to post 
			this blog before 11:00pm; every other night has been posted at that 
			hour or much, much later.&nbsp; Blame school, blame work, and 
			blame...well, myself of course.&nbsp; But tonight, there are far 
			more important things than the blog.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Burrito Bandito.&nbsp; </b>This is a small Mexican restaurant 
			that I found near my place of work, and I love it.&nbsp; For $3.78 
			with tax, I can get a sizely bean and cheese burrito, a half order 
			of Baby Banditos, and a drink.&nbsp; Believe me, it fills me up.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			And for the third day straight, I have a picture!&nbsp; 'Cept this 
			picture isn't of a sunset, labyrinth, or other such amusements.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			No.&nbsp; It's my lunch.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img height="373" src="../pics/IMAGE_00003.jpg" width="470"></p>
			<p>
			Looks tasty, doesn't it?&nbsp; I don't know what came over me when I 
			took this picture.&nbsp; I was not particularly impressed with the 
			presentation; forgive me, but I'd seen this plate on numerous other 
			occasions.&nbsp; I just wanted to take a picture of my lunch, and 
			let everyone see it.&nbsp; And I wanted to tell you to try The 
			Burrito Bandito.&nbsp; It's at 19th Avenue and Union Hills Road.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.burritobandito.com/">Huzzah!</a></p>
			<p>
			Technically, the last time I took a picture of my food was in the 
			Missionary Training Center when I was 19 years old.&nbsp; I would 
			regularly take pictures of the grand portions there; after 
			developing them (remember doing that?) I would send them to my 
			parents, either as proof that I was eating or, more likely, to be 
			completely obnoxious.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>Sheesh.&nbsp; It's been quite</b> a week.&nbsp; This is it until 
			Monday, I hope that you have found this week's postings slightly 
			amusing, if not bemusing.&nbsp; Yes, it truly is confusing to go 
			from picture of post-rain sunsets to a styrofoam plate full of fried 
			Mexican food.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			But what can you do?&nbsp; Meet me back here on Monday and I'll try 
			to make it up.</p>

			<p>
			<b>Third night in a row </b>staying up way too late.&nbsp; But this 
			evening, I was especially preoccupied with getting everything ready 
			with my change of e-mail address.&nbsp; That's right, I give up.&nbsp; 
			Spam ruined my favorite e-mail address.</p>
			<p>
			But not to worry!&nbsp; My outsidetheworld.com account came to the 
			rescue.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I had so much on my mind to write about tonight, but it all fails me 
			now.&nbsp; I procrastinated writing far too long, I'm afraid, and 
			now all I have left in me is babble.&nbsp; Unmitigated verbal 
			meandering.&nbsp; Oh wait, I do have a few pictures.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Below you will </b>find a place at work that I frequent whenever 
			I'm having a rough day.&nbsp; It's an eleven circuit labyrinth, and 
			it's supposed to be a place of meditation and prayer.&nbsp; Kind of 
			like Pooh's thoughtful spot, but not as cheerful or blustery.&nbsp; 
			(Correction, Pooh's &quot;Thotful Spot&quot;)&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I never understood the many misspellings in the books and cartoons, 
			but they did me no harm, so I should just be quiet.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Anyway, on to the pictures.&nbsp; Rather than try to remember the 
			purpose of this labyrinth and attempt to paraphrase, I simply took a 
			picture of what &quot;they&quot; said it is.</p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="../pics/IMAGE_00063.jpg" width="465" height="621"></p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="../pics/IMAGE_00064.jpg" width="468" height="354"></p>
			<p>
			Again, you'll have to forgive the fact that these pictures were 
			taken with my phone's camera.&nbsp; But, there it is.&nbsp; The 
			place where you could find me if all else at work had failed.&nbsp; 
			And by all else I mean a package of candy and a game of pool.</p>
			<p>
			It was actually quite beautiful outside today; it was much 
			preferable to the office environment.&nbsp; It was just so blasted
			<i>cold </i>inside my office.&nbsp; I couldn't keep warm or awake, a 
			terrible and rare combination that leads to poor productivity.&nbsp; 
			So, outside to the labyrinth I went, and was greeted by 70 degree 
			sunshine and the chirping of birds.</p>
			<p>
			I think this'll do for the evening.&nbsp; Have a great day and week 
			ahead...it's almost Friday.&nbsp; We can make it to Friday, right?&nbsp; 
			Right.</p>
			<p>
			P.S. The weather widget was <i>never </i>right, so I removed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			39 degrees at 11:00am?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Good riddance.</p>

			<b>Just a short entry today.&nbsp; </b>To make up for it, however, 
			I'm providing pictures for your viewing enjoyment.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I'm already looking at the 11:00 hour as I write this.&nbsp; Tuesday 
			is the longest day of the week for me, with school and all.&nbsp; 
			And for whatever reason, class just crawled by tonight.&nbsp; It was 
			all I could do to keep from looking at the time.</p>
			<p>
			There was a short unanticipated rain storm today in the valley.&nbsp; 
			When I left work at six, the clouds were barely breaking and the sun 
			was shining in the best way imaginable.&nbsp; The pollution had all 
			been swept away; every mountain range within 100 miles was clearly 
			visible with the orange sunlight casting textures upon them.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I tried to take a few pictures to summarize what I saw.&nbsp; 
			Share and enjoy!</p>

			<p>
			<b>11:19pm.&nbsp; What<font color="#003366"> </font></b>am I doing 
			up at this hour?&nbsp; I really should be asleep.&nbsp; For some 
			unbelievably ridiculous reason, I procrastinated the writing of six 
			two page papers until the last bleeding moment.&nbsp; Yes, that does 
			equal roughly 160 pages to be read and 12 pages to be written, in 
			less than six hours.&nbsp; Come to think of it, I'm fairly proud of 
			myself. </p>
			<p>
			Problem is, the papers themselves are complete garbage.&nbsp; I'd 
			probably give them a D if I graded them myself.&nbsp; Simply not too 
			proud of them.&nbsp; But what else can you really expect?&nbsp; I'm 
			just elated that I'll have something to turn in tomorrow night when 
			I head to class.</p>
			<p>
			<b>So now, as </b>some form of outlandish punishment, I sit here at 
			my desk writing more unconscious drivel in the form of this blog 
			entry.&nbsp; I admit it; I'm hooked to writing it.&nbsp; Besides, I 
			did send out the general e-mail to everyone about four hours ago, 
			informing them that Outside the World had again reopened.&nbsp; So, 
			if you followed that e-mail here to my silly blog, welcome.&nbsp; 
			This is all there is for now, really.&nbsp; Please don't be too 
			disappointed.&nbsp; Try to remain temporarily disillusioned.&nbsp; 
			There.&nbsp; That's better.</p>
			<p>
			Nothing much else to report on, I'm afraid.&nbsp; The wife and child 
			got back from Mesa late this evening, both stricken with some sort 
			of flu bug that I desperately hope to avoid.&nbsp; Poor Sumner came 
			home asleep in his mother's arms, and I'm afraid that's the 
			condition that he preferred for the remainder of the evening.&nbsp; 
			Poor guy.&nbsp; You just feel terrible when a child gets lambasted 
			by a virus that should only be meant for adults that can handle it.&nbsp; 
			And by adults I don't mean myself,
			<a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/archive.htms/112403-112703.htm">
			for I have never handled the flu season with much steadfastness.&nbsp;
			</a>(see 11/25/03)</p>
			<p>
			Oh, one final thing before I retire for the evening.&nbsp; You've 
			probably noticed that this particular page loads considerably slower 
			than it had previously.&nbsp; Well, that's because I added a weather 
			widget on the bottom of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, whenever you get 
			a hankering to find out what the temperature is in Glendale, you can 
			visit my site!&nbsp; Gee, the utter uselessness of the widget is 
			finally manifesting itself to me.</p>
			<p>
			I'm hoping that it will work itself out and &quot;be more faster&quot; (see 
			Homer Simpson, &quot;Stupid TV, be more funny!&quot; episode), but I'll end up 
			removing it soon because it's just <i>irritating</i>.</p>
			<p>
			On a sad note, my stupid wireless mouse keeps reverting into a 
			paperweight.&nbsp; It's turned itself into an unrecognized USB 
			device 14 times this evening, and I don't believe it's concerned 
			enough with its dismal performance to stop at any point.&nbsp; Alas, 
			time to put it to rest.</p>
			<p>
			Speaking of which, this entry could use a rest, as well as my hands.&nbsp; 
			Good day to you all!</p>

			<b>Another week is </b>upon us.&nbsp; Well, not for me, not yet at 
			least.&nbsp; It's still Sunday night as I type this.&nbsp; My friend 
			and I just spent a good couple of hours playing Lufia II for the 
			Super Nintendo.&nbsp; Lufia is an old RPG that we used to play for 
			hours and hours when we were still in high school.&nbsp; Ah, good 
			times. </p>
			<p>
			That's the great thing about the Super Nintendo.&nbsp; The games 
			just don't seem to get old; they really retain their replay value.&nbsp; 
			As a side note to this topic, the wife and I had been looking for a 
			used Wheel of Fortune game for a while now.&nbsp; In our weekend 
			pursuits, we happened across an extremely cheap copy of the game for 
			the Nintendo 64, the successor to the aforementioned Super Nintendo.&nbsp; 
			We decided to purchase it, and upon playing it at home, only got one 
			game out of it before we turned it off.&nbsp; It just looked so 
			dated.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The wife and child are away at the moment, visiting her mom and dad 
			in Mesa.&nbsp; Since she has observations down there on Mondays 
			anyway, she decided to spend the night there instead of waking up at 
			the crack of dawn.&nbsp; Smart lass.&nbsp; But now, the house is 
			empty and quiet, and I don't feel much like sleeping.&nbsp; So, I 
			update.</p>
			<p>
			<b>On Saturday, </b>we celebrated two birthdays.&nbsp; My mother 
			turned X years on the 18th, so happy birthday to her, indeed.&nbsp; 
			I found her two bags of lemons on the side of the road, and 
			delivered them personally.&nbsp; No, I lied; the wife found them.&nbsp; 
			But I delivered them.</p>
			<p>
			Was that all I gave her, you ask?&nbsp; Why no, we also purchased 
			the game SceneIt! for her.&nbsp; My wife said that she mentioned 
			wanting it once upon a time, and she did seem pretty excited to 
			receive it.&nbsp; Oh, and we got her a small box of chocolates that 
			I thought were Jordan almonds.&nbsp; Darn packaging trickery.</p>
			<p>
			It was also Jenna's grandpa's 80th birthday.&nbsp; Good on him for 
			it.&nbsp; The entire family spent the afternoon at a park near our 
			house, wind and all.&nbsp; I swear that man doesn't seem 80 years 
			old to me.&nbsp; He was running around, chasing his 
			great-grandchildren around that park like he was 30 years younger.&nbsp; 
			I can only hope to be able to move as fast at that age.</p>
			<p>
			Most of the family played a game of softball to round out the 
			festivities, myself included.&nbsp; During a &quot;crucial&quot; point in the 
			game, my brother-in-law had to run to home plate, so I covered 
			second in his stead.&nbsp; Headed directly for me was my wife's 
			cousin, by no means a small person, and he creamed me.&nbsp; 
			Completely bowled me over.&nbsp; My hip still hurts.</p>
			<p>
			But no matter.&nbsp; It was fun nonetheless.&nbsp; Sunday was very 
			uneventful, Sumner and I had to return home early on during church 
			time because he wasn't having any part of it.&nbsp; His finger was 
			stuck in his mouth the entire car-ride home, so I reckon he might 
			have been teething.&nbsp; Or he might just want me to have believed 
			so.&nbsp; Trust me, the little kid is getting smarter each day, so I 
			put nothing past him at this point.&nbsp; For crying out loud, we 
			just had our first telephone conversation today.</p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;Hello?&quot;</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;Daddy?&nbsp; I'va shoe!'</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;You have a shoe?&quot;</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;Yah! A shoe!&nbsp; Hi?&quot;</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;Hello, Sumner!&nbsp; I love you!&quot;</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#800000"><b>&quot;Love you, Daddy.&nbsp; Bye!&quot;</b></font></p>
			<p>
			That's pert much how it was hammered out.&nbsp; He turns two in 
			about three weeks.&nbsp; I won't cliché this blog by saying that the 
			time is going by too fast, but dangit if it is.</p>
			<p>
			<b>I'd imagine </b>this is long enough for a Monday entry.&nbsp; 
			Like me, I'm sure you all have a load of work/school/other to catch 
			up on, so enjoy it, and certainly enjoy your entire week.&nbsp; I'll 
			be back tomorrow with more disreputable drivel.&nbsp; Cheers!</p>
			<p>
			<b>P.S. @ 11:34pm&nbsp; </b>I'd like to know who's visiting lately. 
			If you've a moment, <a href="mailto:rd@outsidetheworld.com">drop me 
			a line.</a></p>
			<p>
			<b>Yet another P.S. at 12:49am&nbsp; </b>The <a href="../news.htm">News</a> 
			section of OTW has just been added!&nbsp; We'll see how this works 
			out.&nbsp; Keep in mind, I don't select the news, I just pass it on.&nbsp; 
			So when weird things get on there, don't tell me.&nbsp; Tell the A.P.</p>
