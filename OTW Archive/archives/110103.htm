		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Today:&nbsp; An extra special weekend edition of the blog, in all 
			its glory!</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, I put some of the finishing touches on my
			<a href="../index.htm">Professional</a> Web site today.&nbsp; For any 
			of you who may pass by this site, please tell me what you think!&nbsp; 
			Additionally, I would appreciate any word-of-mouth advertising that 
			you could offer.&nbsp; </font> </p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This morning, I left for Petsmart on my scooter to purchase Dobby 
			some essentials, i.e. litter and food, and upon my arrival back at 
			home, I found a small kitten outside of my door.&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; 
			I doubt it!&nbsp; I took him inside, bathed him, tried to feed him 
			(at least, I think it was a he?), and dried him all up.&nbsp; </font> </p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He attacked Dobby.&nbsp; Wrong thing to do.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, I took him to a shelter.&nbsp; But now, I have a problem.&nbsp; 
			I want another kitty.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think Dobby deserves a 
			friend too, with Wife and I being gone so often.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anyway, so please, refer someone to the site. If you want 
			business cards, put in a request <a href="../contactus.htm">here</a>, 
			and I'll mail them promptly!&nbsp; Have a good weekend!</font></p>
