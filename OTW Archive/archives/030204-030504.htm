			<b>So,</b> <a href="http://dop.outsidetheworld.com/rants.html">
			continuous nagging <i>does</i> work</a>.&nbsp; That's great.</p>
			<p>
			<b>It rained today</b>.&nbsp; Large amounts of torrential downpour, 
			it was...Wife and I decided to go to Tagliani's to get some take out 
			food.&nbsp; I tried to convince her to stay at home while I left, 
			but she would have nothing to do with that.&nbsp; About 2 miles into 
			the journey however, certain events wrought change upon her mind.&nbsp; 
			The rain came down in sheets, I tell you, and I couldn't see 
			anything for the life of it all.&nbsp; First, we have no windshield 
			wipers on the driver's side.&nbsp; Second, the brakes sound....well, 
			they sound possessed.&nbsp; It literally sounds like demons will 
			leap from the depths of the discs and drums, for crying out loud.&nbsp; 
			And I do believe they were wretching by the time we got home. </p>
			<p>
			It was kind of cute to watch her pray to herself in the passenger 
			seat.&nbsp; I could have said I told you so.&nbsp; Wait a minute, I 
			did!</p>
			<p>
			<b>Some sort of record?&nbsp; </b>That second paragraph was huge.&nbsp; 
			Completely unlike me.&nbsp; I never write that large of paragraphs, 
			and if I do, I have the insatiable compulsion to hack it up into 
			pieces.&nbsp; Doesn't make sense?&nbsp; Doesn't matter!&nbsp; All 
			for the sake of aesthetics, mind you.&nbsp; All in the name of 
			pseudo-lit.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>The Passion</b>.&nbsp; Yes, I remembered.&nbsp; I mentioned 
			yesterday briefly that I would write a bit about this movie.&nbsp; 
			While I haven't seen it, I feel some sort of responsibility to 
			explain.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			And don't assume that I won't attend.&nbsp; I was waiting for 
			something to happen before I gave myself time to ponder this film.&nbsp; 
			I wanted to see if a certain writer/critic/believer would say 
			something about it, since he seems to have a great deal to discuss 
			about everything else.</p>
			<p>
			<a href="http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-29-1.html">
			And I got my wish</a>.&nbsp; For those of you not familiar with 
			Orson Scott Card, you definitely should.&nbsp; He's a remarkable 
			thinker with a keen mind for culture and society.&nbsp; He has 
			enough similarities to smaller folk to make him approachable, yet he 
			possesses the intellect to request a certain amount of respect.</p>
			<p>
			In the aforementioned article, he strips his essay into three 
			distinct parts:&nbsp; His views as a film critic, a believer, and an 
			American.&nbsp; It's not sappy in any way, and it really provides a 
			three dimensional aspect to his opinion.&nbsp; Because that's all 
			that it is, beautiful opinion.</p>
			<p>
			I was left to myself after reading the article, albeit none the 
			closer to my goal of deciding whether to see this movie.&nbsp; I 
			like to make decisions for myself, but for this one, it seems a bit 
			more thought and influence outside of my body is needed.&nbsp; 
			Sometimes I think too much.&nbsp; I assume you're thinking the same 
			exact thing.</p>
			<p>
			<b>New Links</b>.&nbsp; It's been a long week, and I'm happy to see 
			two of my good friends begin writing again.&nbsp; If you haven't 
			taken a look at the links to the right, go ahead and check them out.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://dop.outsidetheworld.com/">Difference of Opinion</a> 
			is the fine creation of my friend Eric, who is a Computer Science 
			major.&nbsp; Hence, the binary code as the back drop.&nbsp; His 
			rants are continually choice, and I'm glad they're back.</p>
			<p>
			<a href="http://www.tech-desk.net/thoughts.htm">Heg's Thoughts</a> 
			is my friend Peter's site.&nbsp; His writings are fewer and further 
			between, but they are often more poignant and subtle.&nbsp; 
			Definitely worth a gander as well.</p>
			<p>
			I deserve a break.&nbsp; Thanks for the visits, it's always 
			appreciated and this whole project will be back on Monday.&nbsp; 
			Until then.</p>

			<b>So they</b> weren't lying, after all.&nbsp; Their subs are A. 
			Toasty B. Tasty and C.&nbsp; They do have a pepper bar.&nbsp; But it 
			wasn't the pepper bar that I had expected.&nbsp; For some strange 
			reason, I believed that they had all sorts of exotic &quot;shaking&quot; 
			peppers that you could use on your subs.&nbsp; And well, since my 
			wife has gotten me into really nice pepper, I was sort of excited.&nbsp; 
			Fine, I wasn't disappointed, I just now stand corrected.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/pepperbar.jpg" width="358" height="294"><br>
			Yes, they have a pepper bar.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/toasty.jpg" width="358" height="294"><br>
			The proof is in the pudding.&nbsp; Well, in the bread, at any 
			rate...</p>
			<p>
			<b>I promise </b>that this is my final entry regarding Quiznos.&nbsp; 
			And hey, we all got a laugh, I'm sure.&nbsp; I suppose that it's 
			only fitting that this strange adventure ends in the culmination of 
			the visit to the restaurant.&nbsp; Side note:&nbsp; My wife thought 
			that the place was cute.&nbsp; It was, but it wasn't wholly 
			original.&nbsp; I'd seen cuter.</p>
			<p>
			<b>On to bigger and better things.&nbsp; </b>Let's see...this 
			weekend, there are many things afoot.&nbsp; The buddies and I are 
			planning on taking another camping trip to Camp Verde, perchance (<a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/04/0304/030304.html">sorry, 
			James Lileks</a>) we'll visit the hot springs this time around.&nbsp; 
			I think i'll be braver this time and take the camera along for the 
			adventure, as I saw many picture-worthy jewels in the wilderness 
			that day.&nbsp; One could spend an entire day shooting the mountains 
			in that region.</p>
			<p>
			Shortly after we return from the camping trip, it's all business 
			from thereon out.&nbsp; I have to meet with a company regarding a 
			possible Web site design.&nbsp; That should be interesting, and 
			quite a positive experience if I may be so bold.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Sunday is slated for nothing but church and relaxation.&nbsp; 
			Monday?&nbsp; Number 25 for this chap.&nbsp; I haven't a clue what 
			to do for that day, but maybe my wife will make more choco-crisps 
			for me.&nbsp; That's an entirely different topic for another day, 
			keep in mind.&nbsp; I'll be sure to elucidate further next week.&nbsp; 
			See you on Friday.&nbsp; To remind myself, it'll be something about 
			The Passion.</p>
			<p>
			Keep em coming.</p>

			<font color="#003366"><b>So was that it?&nbsp; </b></font>Was that 
			my proverbial moment in the sun?&nbsp; A brief entrance into the 
			realm of super-sites, with visitor averages in the hundreds?&nbsp; 
			Maybe.&nbsp; But at least some people looked around.&nbsp; That's 
			always reassuring.&nbsp; I didn't want to appear as some sort of 
			sell-out, mind you. </p>
			<p>
			Oh fine.&nbsp; If you're really looking for a spong monkey, they 
			aren't here anymore.&nbsp; They left.&nbsp; But you're welcome to 
			stay.</p>
			<p>
			For those of you who may be new to this site, welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			If you care to look around, be my guest; however, I never guarantee 
			that this site is A. Coherent and B. Enjoyable.&nbsp; Although I've 
			been told in times past that it is, indeed, both.</p>
			<p>
			Outside the World is my expression to the world.&nbsp; It's a blog, 
			and it's updated daily, so visit frequently.&nbsp; I don't advertise 
			my writings with cute unsubstantiated statements, as they all make 
			me wretch.&nbsp; But hopefully, with the passing of time, this blog 
			will garner the numbers to justify my emotion.</p>
			<p>
			Past entries will be found in the <a href="../archive.htm">Archives</a>.&nbsp; 
			I recommend that you try that first, because everything else won't 
			make sense without it.&nbsp; If you go to the <a href="../personal.htm">
			Personal</a> page, you will find other assorted hoo-hah material, 
			such as pictures and writings.&nbsp; If you really feel brave, get a
			<a href="OldPages/mail.htm">free e-mail address</a>, too.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Ah, come on.&nbsp; Don't I have the right to exhibit my own wares?&nbsp; 
			Fine.&nbsp; If you're ever in the mood for some truly excellent 
			writing, rather than mangled consonant-mash, you could always try my
			<a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net">brother's site</a>.&nbsp; He 
			likes natural soap.</p>
			<p>
			<b>On to other things</b>.</p>
			<p>
			I need some new music, but I lost my registration key.&nbsp; As I 
			installed my copy of Acid 4.0, a small thought kept jumping up in my 
			mind, demanding I give it attention.&nbsp; A slight itch, reminding 
			me that this product requires registration before use.&nbsp; Where 
			had I put this code?&nbsp; Doesn't matter, I'll just zip right 
			through it and hopefully it'll let me use the program that I 
			rightfully own.</p>
			<p>
			It's funny how we humans believe our own lies, even after only 30 
			seconds of false encouragement.&nbsp; By the time the program had 
			finished installing, I had built myself up for success.&nbsp; I 
			expected to be able to use this program.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			&lt;double click&gt; <font color="#008080">Hi! Registration code, please?&nbsp; 
			Because we own you and not vice versa?</font> (yes I'm thinking and 
			therefore writing in sentence fragments.&nbsp; I care.)</p>
			<p>
			I was so vehemently disappointed.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Another 
			month, and I'll be ready to give them a call and voice my opinion.&nbsp; 
			Or I'll just call and act really nice and hope they give me a new 
			key. </p>
			<p>
			<b>Ho, boy</b>.&nbsp; It's been a dry day, for sure.&nbsp; Any 
			evidence of this is apparent in the above paragraphs.&nbsp; Promises

			<p>
			<b>Site Stats</b>.&nbsp; If anything motivates me with this Web 
			site, it's when I check the daily statistics and see what brought 
			visitors here.&nbsp; When I checked this morning, I realized that I 
			had become inundated with requests for one thing:</p>
			<p>
			<b>Spong monkeys</b>.</p>
			<p>
			It's now apparent that those funny furry animals have made Quiznos 
			very, very famous indeed.&nbsp; For crying out loud, 12 out of 13 
			queries were for that commercial.&nbsp; The number one hit was &quot;<font size="-1">spong 
			monkey&quot;, with a whopping 49 inquiries for the past two days.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p>
			<font size="-1">I ran across what appears to be the first appearance 
			of these spongmonkeys.&nbsp; You may find it very interesting and 
			annoying at the same time.&nbsp; The Web site is
			<a href="http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song/">here</a>.&nbsp; It's 
			an endearing song about how much they love the Moon.&nbsp; Joel 
			Veitch, you're a genius.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and you're probably very 
			rich now, too.&nbsp; Jerk.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p>
			<font size="-1">And now I don't know whether to be proud that my 
			site is back up to 66 visits per day.&nbsp; It's obvious that 
			they're only coming now for the 'monkeys.&nbsp; Well, that's just 
			fine with me, I got the bandwidth, and I ain't that proud.</font></p>

			<b>Teen Girl Squad.&nbsp; </b>Hard to believe that we're up to
			<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/tgs5.html">number five</a>, 
			but that's where life has led us.&nbsp; Strong Bad introduces us to 
			the fact that the others really don't like
			<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/tgs5.html">What's her Face</a>.&nbsp; 
			And if you look closely enough, you'll see that her last name really 
			is &quot;Herface&quot;.&nbsp; The obvious moral of this issue is to avoid 
			dipping your head in the sand at the beach.&nbsp; If you do, the 
			following may happen to you:</p>
			<p>
			A.&nbsp; You will inhale sand (and cigarette butts)<br>
			B.&nbsp; Birds will find you an attractive perch<br>
			C.&nbsp; Presidents and body builders will stop and mock</p>
			<p>
			Ah the humor of <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestarrunner</a>.&nbsp; Long live the king.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Preparations</b>.&nbsp; Since life is barreling along with the 
			velocity of a snapshot, the wife and I have been afoot with the 
			usual pre-birth preparations.&nbsp; We managed to rearrange the 
			second room and reclaim an entire wall, that will definitely come in 
			useful when the babe arrives.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			To sum my wife up in a few words:&nbsp; She is simply amazing.&nbsp; 
			I'd imagine that I could search through a few previous blogs and 
			find that same phrase more than a few times, but it needs to be said 
			more often.&nbsp; On Saturday night, my work held a huge bonus party 
			at a local joint called Rawhide.&nbsp; I was really looking forward 
			to it because there were so many people at work that had been 
			chomping at the bit to meet the lovely dame.</p>
			<p>
			I asked her to take her time and get all dolled up for the event, 
			but what walked through that door was nothing short of angelic.&nbsp; 
			She's eight months pregnant and she looks absolutely perfect, and 
			everyone there knew it.&nbsp; I had the belle of the ball and I was 
			damn proud of it, thanks.</p>
			<p>
			When I returned to work today, most people who had met her that 
			night had more than a few comments for me.&nbsp; She was described 
			as glowing, beautiful, and sweet.&nbsp; More fitting words could not 
			be found, for sure.</p>
			<p>
			<font size="-1"><b>And why am I here</b>?&nbsp; Too many questions, 
			even more answers.&nbsp; You'll find out soon.&nbsp; Until then, 
			keep coming back.&nbsp; Invite a friend.&nbsp; I take
			<a href="http://www.quiznos.com">all coupons</a>.</font></p>
