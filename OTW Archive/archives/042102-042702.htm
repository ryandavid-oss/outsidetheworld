				Greetings to you this fine day...<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It's funny to think about life sometimes. I only say this 
				because i'm waiting for the bad to come at any time now. I was 
				able to get rid of my Honda and find a much more suitable car 
				for my purposes, and i have what appears to be a dream job at a 
				growing company. I'm happy, i have friends, the weather is still 
				too hot, but that won't change till October. No rain. But 
				nevertheless, life is cruising along at an incredible pace. In 
				the words of Elder Nielson, life's so good, <i>it's scary...</i><br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This week has been spent mainly in the classroom at Cox. I 
				won't delve into this too much since i may be divulging too much 
				information, but know that it is both challenging and fun. I 
				believe that i can stay a while at this company. This weekend, 
				my friend Neal will be flying home from Idaho to spend a week in 
				between semesters with his family. It'll be good to see him and 
				spend some time with him before he leaves again for school. He 
				is the last remnant of my friends that aren't married yet, a 
				rare and highly (not) coveted rank on the Totem pole of life. 
				No, really. I swear.<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Why am i not married? Because i don't know. Why aren't you 
				married? And don't give me anything like, &quot;well, actually i am&quot; 
				because that doesn't cut it with me anymore. I need something 
				more substantial to go on here, not just a reception invitation 
				to pad your list of presents. Want to know how many receptions 
				i've been to in my life? 3. My brother's, my ex girlfriend's, 
				and my best friend Jake's. I may, and i can't confirm this, but 
				it's a pretty safe bet, have a fear of commitment. Who knows, 
				who knows.<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Well, have a wonderful weekend. Catch you on the other side 
				of Sunday...<br>

				Tomorrow i start my new job...<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>By a show of hands, how many people hate the feeling of the 
				first day on the job? I know i don't really care for it. 
				Honestly, it doesn't matter to me how prepared i am, how focused 
				and intent i make myself on creating a good impression, i will 
				invariably feel a little out of sorts that first day. I am 
				starting my long-awaited job at Cox Communications tomorrow, 
				where i will be doing what they call E-Care...i will be handling 
				customer service and techical issues for clients of Cox. The 
				great thing about the job is that i get to do all of this by <i>
				email</i>...and i can avoid the phones a lot of the time. So, 
				all of you who think that they can now call me directly to solve 
				all of your cable woes, sorry charlie...this cat don't play that 
				way. <br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>For the past couple of months, i have delved into the world 
				of computer upgrades and services on the side. Not a bad little 
				rap, i suppose, i have had a lot of success but haven't made a 
				bit of money. I seem to have this problem with charging people 
				for things that seem a little fun to me, i suppose. So if anyone 
				needs their computers networked, upgraded, or repaired, let me 
				know. I will try my hardest to let you pay me.<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>I have also purchased a new scooter, it's one of the funnest 
				things i have ever owned in my life. I use it mainly to get 
				around the neighborhood, and i will use it eventually to get to 
				work. I am trying to sell my car, so if anybody that you know is 
				interested in purchasing, point them to my car's webpage
				<a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/carpage.htm">here</a>. 
				It's a great car.<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p>So, that's about it for now. I'm going to go ride my scooter.<br>
