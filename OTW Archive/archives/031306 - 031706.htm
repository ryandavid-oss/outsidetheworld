			<b>I forget.&nbsp; </b>Is it St. Patrick's day?&nbsp; I think I may 
			have blogged about this in past&nbsp; years, but when I was much 
			younger, my friend Jimmy and I would search the wooded areas near 
			his house for leprechauns.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a tradition on each 
			St. Patrick's Day.&nbsp; We both would swear that we could see them 
			darting throughout the trees, keeping their pots of gold or bubble 
			pipes just out of reach of us.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Because you know, back then the pipes only had bubbles in them.&nbsp; 
			What else could it be?</p>
			<p>
			<b>I probably shouldn't </b>make this a terribly long blog tonight.&nbsp; 
			I fudged on my homework and writing this entry isn't exactly 
			supporting my case for not doing it.&nbsp; Plus, I worked nearly all 
			day long on a Web site for work (yes, I know, I just said I don't 
			like doing sites for other people, but this is work!) and I'm just 
			plain tired to seeing FrontPage for the time being.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Interesting note:&nbsp; &quot;Frontpage&quot; is categorized as a spelling 
			error.&nbsp; &quot;FrontPage&quot; is not.</p>
			<p>
			<b>As this is the </b>last blog for the week, it should be mentioned 
			that it is to be another rainy weekend.&nbsp; So, bring those 
			umbrellas and hooded sweatshirts back out for one more rainy 
			Saturday.&nbsp; I hope you don't wash your car.&nbsp; If you own a 
			Prius, I'm not too worried about you.</p>
			<p>
			If you don't know what I'm talking about, well, you're just not 
			reading this enough, are you?</p>
			<p>
			<b>The Office</b> quote of the night:&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			(How to get them to understand?) &quot;Well, I'm like Superman, and these 
			people are like citizens of Gotham City!&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;That's Batman, Michael.&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;Ok, well, I'm Aquaman.&nbsp; Where does Aquaman live?&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;In the ocean.&quot;</p>
			<p>
			&quot;Nerds.&nbsp; I work with a bunch of nerds.&quot;</p>
			<p>
			<b>End The Office quote.</b></p>
			<p>
			Have a great weekend!&nbsp; Monday it is, then!</p>

			<b>I just got home</b> from school.&nbsp; Like I mentioned 
			yesterday, I cannot promise that this entry will have depth or 
			meaning, but that's not really a big deal.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			My brother is chatting with my over MSN and continues laughing about 
			something.&nbsp; That something would be this:</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="flotsam/button.jpg" width="115" height="30"></p>
			<p>
			In many respects, it deserves whatever criticism comes its merry 
			way.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and I do mean <b>regrettably</b>, that is 
			what I used to call my blog.&nbsp; I haven't a clue what I meant by 
			it.&nbsp; I think I was playing around with a thesaurus or perhaps I 
			drew a name out of a black hat in a dark room.&nbsp; Who knows, 
			really.&nbsp; At least it's over with, done.</p>
			<p>
			I mentioned to him that I could just see him laughing.&nbsp; The <i>
			Wedge</i>.&nbsp; Ooh!</p>
			<p>
			<b>I also mentioned </b>yesterday that I would try to post another 
			picture of the snowy vistas surrounding Phoenix.&nbsp; Well, a 
			combination of higher temperatures and increased pollution did not 
			permit me to obtain a good shot.&nbsp; But I got one nonetheless.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<a href="../pics/IMG_2044.JPG">
			<img border="2" src="../pics/IMG_2044_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../IMG_2044.JPG"></a></p>
			<p>
			Sadly, it's just about as blurry as the phone camera pics because I 
			had to digitally zoom so far to get a good enough view of the capped 
			mountain in the distance.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			And as a special treat, a somewhat better picture of the (I think) 
			C-130 on the tarmac at Deer Valley Airport.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<a href="../pics/IMG_2046.JPG">
			<img border="2" src="../pics/IMG_2046_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../IMG_2046.JPG"></a></p>
			<p>
			Now I'm rambling <b>and</b> posting silly pictures.&nbsp; I should 
			probably end this for now.&nbsp; Overall, a fairly anemic post, but 
			fun nonetheless.&nbsp; Have a great day!</p>
			<p>

			<p>
			<b>Long day.&nbsp; </b>Nearly half of it was spent at work, rather 
			than the usual 1/3.&nbsp; That never ceases to strike me as strange; 
			we humans spend eight out of the 24 hours working.&nbsp; I guess it 
			all means something, though.</p>
			<p>
			The reason for the few extra hours today was a deadline that I'm 
			working toward.&nbsp; I've been told that my time management skills 
			could use some work (who am I to argue?) so I'm definitely focused 
			on attaining this.&nbsp; I was only able to finish about 50% of what 
			needed to be done.&nbsp; More tomorrow!</p>
			<p>
			<b>When I drove</b> to work this morning, I traveled on my usual 
			route of the 101 to the 1-17, then exit.&nbsp; But something caught 
			my eye when I curved around the loop toward the 17; snow.&nbsp; It 
			was everywhere.&nbsp; Each mountain range within eye shot was dusted 
			with white.&nbsp; It was absolutely beautiful.</p>
			<p>
			I only wish that I had a camera at that moment.&nbsp; Well, not at 
			that very moment. If I had attempted to take a picture, the results 
			could have been disastrous.&nbsp; Photography and moving automobiles 
			rarely mix, if ever.&nbsp; But I did manage to take these with my 
			camera phone later on in the day.&nbsp; I sincerely apologize in 
			advance for the terrible quality.&nbsp; Truly, these images deserved 
			better justice.</p>

			Garbage.&nbsp; You can hardly even see the snow.&nbsp; Anyway, it's 
			there, if you look really hard.&nbsp; If the snow is still there 
			tomorrow, I promise to provide better shots.</p>
			<p>
			<b>You might notice </b>the absence of several links on the Web site 
			lately.&nbsp; It's all in preparation to reintroduce the site near 
			the end of this month.&nbsp; Also, many pages lack important 
			functionality as my new host is making normal operation difficult.&nbsp; 
			My good friend Eric also wishes to blame Microsoft, but that's a 
			given and I feel much better picking on something that I pay for on 
			a monthly basis.</p>
			<p>
			<b>School tomorrow night.&nbsp; </b>Therefore, few, if any, promises 
			are made for an update to Wednesday's blog.&nbsp; School just lays 
			waste to my energy levels, especially after work.&nbsp; At least 
			it's an interesting class.&nbsp; Now, if only I had a text book to 
			use.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Does anyone else think the clover in the banner image is a little 
			big?&nbsp; I do.</p>
			<p>
			Oh, I'm rambling now.&nbsp; Time to end this.&nbsp; Good day to you 
			all!</p>
			<p>
			<b>PS @ 9:54pm </b>There are a lot of ways to get to old defunct 
			areas of this Web site.&nbsp; Do me (and yourself) a favor and don't 
			get too click happy!&nbsp; You might run into an interminable loop!</p>

			<b>I'm still </b>getting used to the updates.&nbsp; You'll have to 
			excuse me while I attempt to locate my routine in all of this.&nbsp; 
			You'll also have to excuse me if this entry gets a little open ended 
			and meandering.&nbsp; I'm watching/listening to Winnie the Pooh for 
			the Nth time this weekend.</p>
			<p>
			Wife and I had a rather enjoyable weekend together, although not 
			much was truly accomplished.&nbsp; Friday night we decided to rent a 
			video game and eat frozen pizza at home while the 'rents watched our 
			boy.&nbsp; Turns out Blockbuster nixed our membership a while back; 
			they wanted us to spend a little while and fill out their 
			application.&nbsp; It didn't take much for me to turn my back on 
			that.</p>
			<p>
			So, we ended up still eating cold pizza, but instead of a video 
			game, we went grocery shopping.&nbsp; Fair trade.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Saturday was spent seeing family and friends.&nbsp; My buddy Neal 
			and I drove around in the never ending rain.&nbsp; I received a free 
			burger coupon from Red Robin for my birthday, and seeing how that is 
			one of our favorite eating establishments, we dropped by late in the 
			evening to pay them a visit.&nbsp; However, 45 octogenarians decided 
			to spoil that event by attempting to seat themselves at the 
			aforementioned restaurant five minutes before we arrived.&nbsp; 
			Harrumph. </p>
			<p>
			<b>I never did</b> give a report on my birthday now, did I?&nbsp; 
			What a tremendous day.&nbsp; Kudos indeed to my beautiful wife for 
			managing to procure an XBOX 360 AND not tell me about it.&nbsp; 
			She's always had a hard time keeping surprises from me, bless her 
			heart; I could tell how excited she was when I finally opened that 
			present up last.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			And my, that 360 is quite a beast.&nbsp; Forget whatever reviews you 
			may have read online.&nbsp; You really have to see it to believe it.&nbsp; 
			The craftsmanship inside and out is amazing.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The wife also crafted me a wonderful scrapbook detailing our 
			marriage up to this point.&nbsp; Actually, that is my favorite 
			present that she gave me.&nbsp; That particular present is holding 
			semi-permanent residence on my desk at work, for those particular 
			times when I'm in need of a good pick me up.</p>
			<p>
			Another fun happening on my birthday was a rather rousing Web camera 
			session with my brother and his seven kids.&nbsp; Technology can be 
			quite a blessing; this instance in particular.&nbsp; I was actually 
			able to watch and hear each one of them sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to me.&nbsp; 
			Sumner quite enjoyed it too.&nbsp; He's at that point in his life 
			where most things are magic.&nbsp; I'm going to like this phase, and 
			truly will be sad when it nears its end.</p>
			<p>
			There have been more updates to
			<a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net">Bloggenpucky</a> and
			<a href="http://www.codesanctuary.net/">Code Sanctuary</a>; be sure 
			to give them a peek.&nbsp; Eric is outdoing himself with coding and 
			such.&nbsp; You'd have to be&nbsp; true geek to appreciate the in's 
			and out's.&nbsp; Oh, by the way, Code Sanctuary is what was formerly 
			known as The Difference of Opinion Web site, which died long ago. </p>
			<p>
			And look!&nbsp; My old St. Patrick's day banner image is back.&nbsp; 
			That should be fun to use for a little while, at least.</p>
			<p>
			Yeah, that's all.&nbsp; Have a great week!&nbsp; More to come, says 
			I. </p>
