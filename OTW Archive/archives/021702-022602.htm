			<b>Saturday, February 23, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			Live, from Tucson, it's saturday night!<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I decided to head south this weekend and pay a few friends of mine a 
			much delayed visit. I got into town at about 8:00pm, so it was 
			completely dark and i didn't notice much about the surroundings. But 
			when i woke up and went outside, i saw what makes this city so 
			strange: The mountains. It seems as if they've been placed here out 
			of a joke, strange scragly-pointly-blotchy creations that look so 
			out of place, it couldn't look weirder even if there was lava 
			spewing forth from the peaks. But other than that, it looks and 
			feels a lot like the rest of Arizona, flat, hot, and brown. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Not much else of substance to write yet today, i suppose that i 
			could say that i might write more tonight, but from all prior 
			experience, we all know that will not happen. I'll be too tired, 
			lazy, or both to do anything. So be that as it may, you have today's 
			entry. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Peace and love to all.<br>

			You can't help but laugh, right? Right?<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I could say that i've been too busy to write, but that wouldn't be 
			entirely true. I could make excuses like, &quot;i didn't have anything 
			interesting to write&quot;, but that would be completely false. By now, 
			most of you give this site a passing glance just to see if the date 
			has changed, and then shoot off an email or an IM telling me to get 
			writing! So, here goes.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Life is full of surprises both good and bad. I'm beginning to 
			realize on a much deeper level how blessed and, i dare say, how 
			lucky I am. Some people i know would call me a blasphemer for daring 
			to say &quot;luck&quot;, they say they don't believe in luck, maybe i have 
			created my own, but i swear it's out there. Life is, at times, 
			deeper than we realize. If we look outside ourselves and our daily 
			circumstances, we will see the tangible synchronicities of life and 
			the connections we draw from nature. If we can grasp this, it could 
			be well with us...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I don't want to say that i've realized any great truth, or that i've 
			discovered something that hasn't been said before. But in this 
			journey i call my life, i can't help but understand the eternal 
			truths that i've known for my entire existence when they are 
			proposed to me in several different fashions. Truth is everywhere, 
			in varying degrees, and if we filter out any part of it because of 
			our own arrogance or closed mindedness, then we are all the poorer 
			for it and must learn things the hard way. We all have more 
			experience than we realize. Somehow we must tap it.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			So anyway, i hope all is well with everyone. Sorry about the long 
			delay, i swear it won't happen again...<br>
