			<br>
			I brought no pine cones home, sorry.<br>
			<br>
			But what I did bring back was at least a little bit of sanity. I 
			don't really have too much to say today...I called in sick from work 
			because I felt so lousy. This is the kind of lousy that can only 
			come from riding a scooter to work in the very early morning hours, 
			when the air is so cold and wet you just want to turn right around 
			and go back to bed. But, I keep going because I love how much money 
			I'm saving, and really, winters in Arizona don't last very long, 
			right? <br>
			<br>
			And then you realize Winter time is still a month away. Oh, the joy
			<br>
			you feel! But the great news is that I only have to do this until 
			November 9th, when I can start going into work at the decent hour
			<br>
			of 8:00am. That way, at least the sun will have made it's efforts of 
			warming the air before I cut through it on my hyper-scooter. (not 
			really, but it sounds quite cool, I think...)<br>
			<br>
			When I was up in Utah, my friend Marci and I decided to take a late 
			trip up the canyon in her car. It was raining in the valley, not too
			<br>
			bad, but the roads were a little wet. I told myself in my mind that 
			if, upon entering the canyon, I found the roads were still wet or 
			that it was raining in any way, we would turn back. No sense in 
			risking it, right? But all seemed well as we drove closer to the 
			mouth, the roads were dry, and I thought for a minute that I could 
			actually see clear sky. No matter, we continued our course up the 
			road until about 1/4 of the way up. It started to rain a little, but 
			we figured then since we had come so far, why stop now? And rain at 
			the top of the canyon would make it even more beautiful... So. There 
			we were, now half of the way to the summit...and lo and behold, we 
			had fog. Silently, in my mind I knew what was coming next. The air 
			was obviously cold enough for it, but I dared not open my mouth to 
			my traveling companion for fear that she might make me turn my 
			course and head back down the canyon. And about 3/4 of the way up, 
			my thoughts were confirmed to me: <br>
			<br>
			It started snowing.<br>
			<br>
			And it wasn't just a little bit of snow, it was a lot of it. 
			Blinding snow, and the windshield wipers weren't working too well 
			either. So, continuing on, my hands gripped the wheel of this little 
			Honda. Oh, <br>
			and as a side note, this would be the very same Honda that, on one 
			occasion, had careened off the side of the road during a winter snow 
			storm. But she had just put new tires on! 40,000 miles ago. 
			Hmm....better hurry to the top, I said....<br>
			<br>
			We made it without any mishap, and it was surely worth the risk in 
			getting there. The ground had about a half foot of snow, and the 
			trees were glistening under the reflected light of the moon that had 
			just appeared over the crest of the hills. The clouds parted shortly 
			thereafter, and we were left with a beautiful scene of the best 
			nature could possibly offer.<br>
			<br>
			And such is life in Utah, if you really choose to live it. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Postscript: Don't try to find a Cherry Coke at the Salt Lake 
			Airport. Ever. You'll have walked about 2 miles by the time you give 
			up.<br>
