			Greetings and happy Friday.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			This weekend, I will be moving the site to a new host, so you may 
			experience some problems when attempting to view it. This should all 
			be taken care of by Sunday night, and i will email everyone the new 
			address. What's to come? All of my previous writings will be 
			published to the site, so that anyone who is curious may see them. 
			Also, a great little piece of web genius called Difference of 
			Opinion, which is the creation of my friend Eric and his friend 
			Mike. So, be on the lookout for both of those.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Also to come: Curiosities of TV in the desert, Painting the house of 
			Webb, and much more. Stay tuned, for sure.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Enjoy the weekend!<br>

			<b>Thursday, February 28, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			Last day of February.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			This month seemed to fly by for me. And it's funny too, because when 
			i was younger, February was the most painfully slow month that i 
			knew, and the single reason for that is because my birthday is in 
			March. So the days would drag by, until the 8th of March would 
			FINALLY come and i would be a happy child. Well, not that i wasn't 
			happy in the days preceding, but when the days last as long as 
			weeks, well, there's only so much happiness that a 9 year old can 
			achieve when he's waiting for a new Lego set or a Teenage Mutant 
			Ninja Turtle Action figure...and of course my parents always got me 
			exactly what i wanted. Who knows how much money they spent and how 
			many hours they toiled walking up and down department store aisles 
			looking for that darn-blasted Shredder with &quot;action chop right arm&quot;. 
			What a pain i was...my brothers and sister were right when they 
			called me spoiled...well, that's what they get for moving out and 
			leaving me to be the last one in the house.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			So, in roughly eight more days i will be 23 years old. I was talking 
			to my sister yesterday and she said that i was old. I know 23 isn't 
			old, in fact, i'm still relatively young, but when i was younger i 
			thought 23 was ancient and that all people, upon reaching that 
			golden age of 20, turned into giants and were whisked away into 
			outer space to live on larger planets. Yes, i had an over-active 
			imagination as a young boy, but that's why i had so much fun. So, 
			now i'm almost 23, i don't look forward to my birthdays as much as i 
			used to, and to draw testament to this fact, all i really want for 
			my birthday is a new razor. What i wouldn't give to yearn for a new 
			video game or something. Ah, my kingdom for a Lego set.....<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			But really, this wasn't an entry to let you all know that my 
			birthday is coming up...because really, everybody remembers it 
			anyway, right? Also, thanks to the people that emailed me today 
			about other jobs that are out there, i appreciate it and will look 
			into them. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			May your days be filled with happiness. Oh, and Legos...<br>

			Tucson was good for me.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			It was a chance to get away and recoup from the previous weeks' 
			happenings. But i always hate coming back from somewhere fun like 
			that, it's like eating 50 sugar packets and finding you have the 
			energy to run up the wall across the ceiling, only to crash out of 
			your high 35 seconds later and fall flat on your face in horrible 
			spectacle. My friend Eric and I met up with some of his friends to 
			go to an Ice Hockey game (and you may ask, what other type of hockey 
			is there?) I dunno, i just always call it ice hockey. So anyway, we 
			went to this ICE hockey game and U of A won, they were playing ASU 
			so the whole arena was packed. Eric has some cool friends down 
			there; Sara, Jaime, Dan, Erica, and others...i wish i could remember 
			all of their names. So, hello to all of them. I doubt they'll even 
			read this anyway.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Work work work. I've been waiting to hear back from Cox 
			Communications, i've desired a job there for months now. But no word 
			yet, so i plug away at this fine engineering firm that i've been so 
			blessed to be employed by. Other than that, there is very little 
			going on in my life...although i've decided to go to California for 
			a couple of days with my newfound friends from Tucson. It's almost 
			been a year since i've placed a foot on that strange soil, it will 
			be kind of nice to go back. I doubt that i'll even have any chance 
			to see my friends there, much to my chagrin, but that's life. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Check your house and see if there's a light bulb that needs 
			replacing. Your eyes will thank you.<br>
			Unless you stare directly at every light bulb in the house. Then 
			they might get a bit sore after a while.<br>
			Use sunglasses. If anybody asks why you are wearing them, just tell 
			them it's better than not not wearing them. After thinking about 
			this for a while, they'll probably leave you alone...<br>
