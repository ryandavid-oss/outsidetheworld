			<font size="4">Thoughts about iTunes 8.0</font><font size="4" color="#2A6095"><br>
			<br>
			</font></b><font size="2"><b>Installation -</b> Still takes way too 
			long. I won't take the time to elaborate on the specs of my 
			computer, suffice to say that it is well capable. Installation is 
			taking well into the seven minute mark at the point of this post, 
			and shows no sign of stopping soon.&nbsp; iTunes is a notorious 
			resource hog in Windows, and this installations bears the subtle 
			markings of a kindred spirit.&nbsp; <br>
			<br>
			And for that matter, about progress bars; why have them anymore? I 
			cannot remember the last program that used one honestly.&nbsp; This 
			particular progress bar has emptied and filled a dozen or so times 
			since I started installing, whether to tell me that it is computing 
			space requirements, copying new files, removing old files, or 
			*shudder* nothing at all; it's meaningless to the point of 
			intolerable. Note to programmers, or Microsoft, if it is their 
			doing: give me one progress bar that shows the entire wait progress. 
			That'd be great!<br>
			<br>
			<b>Start up - </b>Ooh! A new EULA. Five entire pages by the looks of 
			it, including verbiage about something random and ill-named called &quot;Kerbango 
			Tuning Service&quot;. I won't read it; don't care enough to. Click Agree, 
			move on. <br>
			<br>
			Otherwise, it seems to have started up a tad faster than previous 
			versions. I will remain cautiously optimistic about future 
			beginnings. At this moment, iTunes is unusable to me due to the fact 
			that it began creating artwork thumbnails, which undoubtedly is for 
			the new browsing feature of the program. The program does seem to be 
			taking an inordinate amount of my system resources now, as nothing 
			else will really open up for the time. The program is also hijacking 
			the focus of my desktop from time to time, a behavior I dislike 
			severely.&nbsp; Come to think of it, a behavior that occurs whenever 
			syncing my iPhone.&nbsp; <br>
			<br>
			<b>Inteface - </b>Not bad. Not bad at all. I like the new grid view. 
			I suspect I'll use this instead of coverflow from now on, which 
			always labored unnecessarily on my machine. No other obvious 
			cosmetic changes, which is fine. If I had my way, most of the 
			changes would be under the hood, increasing performance ten-fold! 
			But hah hah, I live in a naive world. There is still the subject of 
			the new visualizations. <br>
			<br>
			The &quot;Genius Sidebar&quot; is present on the right side of the screen, 
			beckoning me to try out the new service that creates smarter 
			playlists based upon the music that I already have in my library.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'll be honest and admit that I am curious to try out this new 
			feature, as I have been looking to reintroduce myself to my own 
			music again, not having listened to it in months. It's amazing to me 
			how Apple repeatedly paves the way for music loves to enjoy their 
			catalog even more. Off to try it out, impressions after I'm done.
			<br>
			<br>
			Side note: I am required to &quot;opt-in&quot; to the Genius sidebar, which 
			stated will send information about my iTunes library to Apple. This 
			particular disclaimer had to be read. Seems ok, so I press on.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Genius sidebar -</b> Halted in my tracks, unfortunately. Well, 
			not halted so much, but delayed significantly. Genius is now 
			gathering information about my library, and by my rough 
			calculations, will take about 10 full minutes to complete. What is 
			so difficult about analyzing my collection of music, I wonder? And 
			that, with much dismay, is only step one of three. <br>
			<br>
			All three steps now concluded, I am prompted to select any track 
			within my library to see related music within the Genius sidebar. I 
			selected a few albums at first, such as Coldplay's newest &quot;Viva la 
			Vida&quot;, and David Gray's &quot;White Ladder (my own personal favorite). My 
			impressions? Underwhelmed at the moment. It's not really 
			recommending any other music within my own library, only offering to 
			complete various albums for money or suggesting I purchase tracks 
			from the iTunes Music Store. That's all well and fine, and I may use 
			that when I am a rich man and can afford music willy-nilly. <br>

			new visualizer - </b>Worth the price of admission, which for me was 
			a full hour of my time. It's beautiful, with spinning spheres and 
			dancing ribbons of light. Every now and again the floating orbs 
			wander about, rotating causally in random orbit. The best part? 
			Unlike other visualizers, which only partially move to the sound of 
			the music, these graphics actually react to each and every beat and 
			grow larger as the sounds reach crescendo. I love it. Will certainly 
			use it.</font></p>

			<font size="2"><b>I hate summer colds.&nbsp; </b>Unlike the 
			other-yearly varieties, it takes me weeks to get over the summer 
			cold.&nbsp; In the winter, I'd be laid out flat in under 24 hours; 
			in the summer, I feel the familiar scratch in the back of the throat 
			for days.&nbsp; It's as if the virus is casually walking down the 
			street and waving as he passes by.&nbsp; Very non-committal, yet 
			very effective none-the-less. </font></p>
			<p>Woke up this morning feeling exceptionally murky.&nbsp; The 
			illness had given up on the congestion and otherwise sneezy 
			behavior, and had moved with bravado to my lungs.&nbsp; This is the 
			worst part.&nbsp; May it depart quickly.</p>
			<p><b>Otherwise, um...</b>I can't really complain too much.&nbsp; 
			The weekend passed by without even a &quot;hello&quot;.&nbsp; It scares me how 
			fast the weeks fly by when you have a baby around.&nbsp; She turned 
			two months old just a few days ago, thereby receiving her latest 
			batch of shots.&nbsp; I am lucky enough to have never been at an 
			appointment such as that for either of my children, therefore 
			understand this reports is coming second-hand.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The wife mentioned that little SaraJane whimpers whenever you lay 
			as much as a tender brushing against her poor thigh where the 
			injections were.&nbsp; With Sumner, you wouldn't have ever known 
			there was a shot given.&nbsp; Just proves the point that no two 
			children are alike.&nbsp; But, perhaps my mind has simply clouded 
			over during the past four years, so that I do not remember Sumner's 
			tendencies clearly enough.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>In five short days, </b>I begin my leave of absence from work.&nbsp; 
			I expect to spend much of the time with the children, but I also 
			wish to focus more effort here while I have the time.&nbsp; I 
			approach the end of the week with much anticipation.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Pretty short post today, but the cold has taken most of my mental 
			powers away for now.&nbsp; Thanks for visiting, and be sure to visit 
			the Moblah'g for good measure.&nbsp; </p>
