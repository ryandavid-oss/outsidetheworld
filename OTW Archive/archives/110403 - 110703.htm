		<font face="Tahoma" size="2">Kudos to my wife for making sure that I write my &quot;blobs&quot; every 
			night.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Thursday nights have become cleaning nights for me.&nbsp; Sad, 
			but true.&nbsp; These are the nights when I wish my wife were home.&nbsp; 
			Then I'd have something else to do other than vacuum.&nbsp; </font> </p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Let's see, something interesting....there must be something going 
			on....</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>NOTHING.</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Wait, no.&nbsp; I talked to my brother in law tonight, and he 
			pledged his assistance to me when he comes home from school.&nbsp; 
			The kid is a whiz with programming, and he should be able to hook me 
			up with some sweet knowledge on database work.&nbsp; Who knows, 
			maybe I'll pour some more time into my Web site now.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I don't think my wife would like that, though.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I think I want a digital camera.&nbsp; This just does do anything 
			justice:</font></p>

			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">But, it'll have to do for now.&nbsp; That's a picture from my 
			cell phone taken of Prescott Valley.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Jeez. I'm really struggling for words tonight.&nbsp; Time to put 
			this dog to bed.</font></p>

			<font color="#003366" face="Tahoma" size="2">11/06/03</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Utah Jazz 91, Phoenix Suns 80.&nbsp; Need I say more?&nbsp; The 
			Jazz are on a roll, 3-1, baby.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Tonight, I rolled out the newest application for my Web site: 
			Free pop-based e-mail.&nbsp; It's pretty sweet stuff, and anyone can 
			sign up for an address.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I thought that it would cost me a pretty penny to register the 
			new domain name of myotw.net (thanks for the suggestion, Peter), but 
			it only cost me $5.00.&nbsp; The company that I work with is simply 
			amazing, and their costs are incredible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">As the week wears on, you'll find that my entries get slimmer and 
			slimmer.&nbsp; I believe that I'm simply worn out; I spend too much 
			time with my <a href="../index.htm">Professional</a> site.&nbsp; But, 
			every e-mail that I get from someone spurs me on.&nbsp; </font> </p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">By the way, if anyone out there knows some easy database 
			programming as it relates to Web development (I'm talking to you, 
			Matt), let me know.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Till tomorrow.&nbsp; Don't freeze! (I'm talking to you, Neal)</font></p>

			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">How can it get so cold so quickly?&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; How can I 
			complain?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It's been so blasted hot this year, I think we can stand few little 
			sub 50 degree days.&nbsp; For all of my northern readers (all 2 of 
			you), that sounds a bit odd.&nbsp; But, let's not be hasty.&nbsp; 50 
			degrees is still a grimy bit cooler than 110, which is was about two 
			weeks ago.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I really can't say that much happened today; at best, it was very 
			much a cut and dry day.&nbsp; Went to work, same stuff there, came 
			home, turned on the television, saw that the Lakers were playing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">So, I decided to watch.&nbsp; Besides, I hadn't yet had the 
			chance to see Malone in a Lakers jersey.&nbsp; I must admit, I don't 
			like it.&nbsp; It looks odd, it smells kind of funny, and they don't 
			pass the ball to him enough.&nbsp; But, they win, and who cares 
			about the rest, eh?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">For me, I'll keep watching the Jazz.&nbsp; Born and bred, I say.&nbsp;
			</font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">A big thanks to all of those who are reading my entries daily.&nbsp; 
			May you have as much fun reading them as I have writing them.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The air is slightly reminiscent of New York in the fall time; the 
			air is crisp, yet breathable, there is a faint scent of cool water 
			that barely crests the breeze <br>
			as you wander outside.&nbsp; It's beautiful, and it hardly lasts 
			here.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">When I awoke this morning, the house was cool and dark.&nbsp; My 
			wife was sound asleep next to me, and the cat was dozing lazily at 
			our feet.&nbsp; I could faintly hear the distant sound of the 
			welcoming fountain outside of our window, and <br>
			I thought to myself: It doesn't get any better than this.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">But it does.&nbsp; My wife made my favorite meal today.&nbsp; 
			Her &quot;famous to me&quot; sour cream enchiladas, which I must say are the 
			best I have ever tasted.&nbsp; The gal can cook, I tell you.&nbsp; 
			She's brilliant.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">I had the opportunity to go running tonight, as my doctor had 
			recently cleared me for a slightly increased work out plan.&nbsp; I 
			decided to go light; I walked outside <br>
			of my complex and into the streets.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">With the cold air cascading into my lungs, I felt young again.&nbsp; 
			I mean, I really <br>
			felt like I was 16 again, I wanted to run five miles.&nbsp; As I set 
			off at a slow yet determined pace, I quickly realized what four 
			months had done to me.&nbsp; My <br>
			left leg quickly seized up and caused me to slow to a walk.&nbsp; It 
			was the <br>
			first time my legs had given up before my lungs.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Upon returning home, I sat down feeling rather crestfallen upon 
			my sofa.&nbsp; I decided to click on the TV to see what I could 
			find, and lo and behold, the Utah Jazz were playing.&nbsp; This 
			should be a treat, I thought bemusedly.&nbsp; Most &quot;analysts&quot; has 
			picked the Jazz to finish dead last, not only in the West, but the 
			league entire.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">It was a rousing game of lead changes and great basketball.&nbsp; 
			I was pleased <br>
			to see the boys win a game tonight, and not only win, but do it in a 
			fairly impressive fashion.&nbsp; They definitely aren't your 
			father's Utah Jazz, but they're <br>
			fun to watch, and I can imagine watching them a great deal more this 
			season.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">That's it for now.&nbsp; I'm going to go yank the catnip away 
			from the cat.&nbsp; He's <br>
			had <i>more</i> than his fill.</font></p>
