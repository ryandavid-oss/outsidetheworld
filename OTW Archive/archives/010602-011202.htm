			<b>Saturday, January 12, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			Weekends are nice.....<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Especially now, having worked the whole week. I actually appreciated 
			the extra little bit o' sleep that i got this morning. You may be 
			asking yourself, &quot;Why <br>
			does he make it sound like a tough thing to work a week&quot;? Well, it 
			isn't, truly.<br>
&nbsp;But you must understand, my last job was working as a &quot;Public Safety 
			Officer&quot; <br>
			at Snowbird ski resort. That basically consisted of staring at 
			little camera <br>
			monitors and oh, walking around. Walking around was the hard part, 
			you see, because i was already half asleep from staring at the 
			aforementioned <br>
			little camera monitors by the time my relief showed. Yeah, it was a 
			hard life.....<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Enough of that. Let's see, something noteworthy about today...not 
			much i <br>
			guess. I did achieve my goal of purchasing the brown bag special at 
			Sonic today...my friend Dan and i were a bit peckish at lunch time 
			and i'll tell you, it was 6 dollars well spent. We didn't do a whole 
			lot else today but Dan's girlfriend Katie came by and told us that 
			she got a job as a massage therapist...kudos to you, Katie.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			That's about it for now, i suppose. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Oh, happy anniversary, Jake and Nicole. 1 year today!<br>

			A small story to end yer day...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I was sent on an errand at work today at about 4:00 pm. My task was 
			to drive to Tempe and drop off a set of plans. Simple enough, but 
			once i entered the freeway, my fun was over. Little did i know but i 
			was about 10 miles from running out of gas, and i ran into some 
			nasty traffic just outside Dunlap Avenue. &quot;Golly&quot;, i think to myself 
			as i putter along at about 1.3 miles per hour, praying to the 
			gasoline gods and everything efficient and holy that my car doesn't 
			die and i become ridiculed by every well fueled Phoenician on his or 
			her way home from work. Prayers were answered, and i was able to 
			make it to a &quot;QT&quot; gas station. I don't know what &quot;QT&quot; stands for, i 
			don't want to know, all i know is the gas flowed and i was able to 
			return to my errand as planned...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Upon arrival at the destination in Tempe, i decided to lounge around 
			a bit. I wandered about inside the red-stoned building where i 
			dropped my goods off and found that it smelled somewhat, but not 
			entirely like the MTC. Random, i know, but it did. When i got to my 
			car (or money pit, as i refer to him now) I listened to NPR for a 
			little while and learnt about a type of music called &quot;Minimalism&quot;. 
			The basic idea of minimalism is to take a few chords and play them 
			over and over again, but at different tempos and rhythms. Sounds 
			dull and trance-like, but it's amazing to me. I listened to several 
			pieces, was incredibly pleased by the simple yet obviously complex 
			patterns that emerged, and promptly turned the station to 104.7 to 
			listen to &quot;today's hottest hits&quot;. I was less than impressed.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Oh well. Life is fun. Thanks for reading...<br>

			Another hour, another idea...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Well, not exactly. I stole this from my elder brother adam. In fact, 
			most of what I'm doing now is just a rip-off of his great ideas. 
			Here is a link for where you can look at any pictures that I post. 
			Just click on &quot;pictures&quot; on the left of the screen, and you should 
			get there. Note: There are no pictures yet. Muah hah. It's an MSN 
			community, slow as all get-out, but it's free and Americans like 
			them freethings.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Oh, I'm an american.<br>
			I thought you knew that.<br>
			You did?<br>
			oh.<br>

			<br>
			I must have a life less ordinary...<br>
			What exactly do I mean when i say that? Simple...as i drove home and 
			felt the 60 degree weather flow in through my car window, I briefly 
			remembered the poor seldom-correct weather man saying &quot;record highs, 
			upper 70's for today.&quot; Oh well. And as the clouds crashed together 
			and made rain, i thanked God that i had been entertained on the way 
			home from work. Oh yes, and this is whilst i was listening to Pink 
			Floyd. The DJ couldn't have picked a better song at that time. Quite 
			synchronous.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Upon returning to my house tonight i found spaghetti on the stove 
			with my own sauce. MY OWN SAUCE. How many people in this world have 
			their own blasted sauce when their mother cooks for them? I realized 
			at this point that i am spoiled and the madness needs to stop. Oh, 
			and i also downed a half stick of margarine on one slice of bread.
			<br>
			Go figure.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Things should get better as time rolls along, but this will do for 
			now. I must see where this goes...<br>
