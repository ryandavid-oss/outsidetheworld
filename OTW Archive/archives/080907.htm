			<font size="4" color="#2A6095"><b>08/09/2007</b></font><p><b>I took 
			a break from writing </b>because I had nothing to write.&nbsp; 
			Plenty to write about now, so let's get started, shall we?</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple redesigned their iMac.</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/08/xbox-360-premium-confirmed-shipping-with-hdmi/">
			The XBOX 360 drops price, and adds HDMI</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/08/wii-update-quietly-adds-limited-usb-keyboard-support/">
			The Wii got an update and came close to, but not quite, practical</a><br>
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20169917/">Bonds hit number 
			756*</a> (dang, that asterisk felt <i>good</i>)</p>
			<p>Those are the things that sticks out in my mind.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; 
			Best to go through each one, then.&nbsp; Here goes!</p>
			<p><b>Apple.&nbsp; </b>Does anyone else think that
			<a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">keyboard</a> is terrible?&nbsp; 
			It can't just be me.&nbsp; Yes, this is a bit off topic from the 
			iMac redesign, but still...it comes packed in now.&nbsp; It's 
			reminiscent of the keyboard on my Macbook, and I hate that keyboard 
			as well.&nbsp; Just glancing at the new keyboard gives me the 
			impression that typing on it might be similar to a Speak N Spell.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>It's obvious that Apple Inc emphasizes design over function; that 
			point has been made for years, even when the
			<a href="http://www.drunkenbatman.com/drunkenblog-archives/tang_ibook.jpgv">
			iBook resembled a toilet seat</a> and their taste was gently forced 
			upon us.&nbsp; But they seem to have reached an impasse with design 
			and quality; items such as the iPhone go far beyond the utilitarian 
			mode and have delved into the realm of insanity.&nbsp; Soon, they 
			will be forcing us to control our devices with gestures.&nbsp; I can 
			only imagine the level of frustration, rising to the point where I 
			throw it the bird and finally convince it to go into standby.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p><b>Xbox 360.&nbsp; </b>I've been waiting for this announcement 
			for a while.&nbsp; Most analysts saw it coming, yet again, if enough 
			of them sound their trumpet long enough, it all turns into 
			background noise on the waves of the InterWebs.&nbsp; When their 
			predictions come to fruition, we can only nod in affirmation at the 
			recollection that someone, somewhere thought of it before and it had 
			to be &quot;that guy&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Anyway.&nbsp; So the Xbox, which I consider to be far superior in 
			almost every way to the Playstation 3, received its first price drop 
			since arriving in late 2005.&nbsp; I wouldn't go so far to call it a 
			bargain...at $350.00, it's still way out of reach of most 
			cost-conscious consumers (alliteration!).&nbsp; Not only the price 
			drop, but confirmation came late Wednesday that any unit built after 
			July 4th, 2007 comes standard with the famed (and useful) HDMI port.&nbsp; 
			As the ubiquity of HDTV's marches on, the inclusion of this 
			connection standard can only be a boon.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>The Wii.&nbsp; </b>I came home on Tuesday night to the mellow 
			beckoning of that cool blue light on the front of my Wii.&nbsp; This 
			could only mean one thing; an update was ready for download and I 
			needed to jump on it.&nbsp; I love the age of connectivity, where my 
			devices receive new life-blood months and years after I purchase 
			them.&nbsp; With my finicky, impulsive buying habits, features that 
			grant extended interest in gadgetry are great thing.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Alas, this update was mostly geared toward stability and 
			thwarting piracy, rather than adding features like previous updates 
			had been.&nbsp; Still, a few neat things managed to squeak through, 
			such as the aforementioned USB keyboard support and a more 
			streamlined Virtual Console shopping experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm 
			still pretty hopeful that all of the things I dreamed about the Wii 
			will come true; the Nintendo DS connectivity, downloadable demos, 
			and DVD playback are just a few of them.&nbsp; Nintendo has a good 
			thing going with the Wii; let's hope they don't screw it up.</p>
			<p>
			<img alt="756* The Duke of Doping shirt" src="../pics/bonds_both.jpg" width="200" height="248" align="left"><b>Bonds.&nbsp;
			</b>What a jerk.&nbsp; I want this t-shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need 
			all of the stuff on the back, though.&nbsp; I just need the 756 with 
			the asterisk.&nbsp; That'd be great.</p>
			<p>I just don't get him.&nbsp; I don't get professional athletes, to 
			be concise.&nbsp; Mr Bonds is the epitomy, nay, the embodiment of 
			the loss of focus on the American fan.&nbsp; Instead, it's a 
			fascination with SportsCenter and Rome is Burning.&nbsp; There's no 
			publicity to these men.&nbsp; Whatever it takes.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>And he's a liar too.&nbsp; Boldface.&nbsp; Times New Roman font.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>And I don't really feel any empathy for the record, either.&nbsp; 
			People have had ample opportunity to speak up and make a stand 
			against this debauchery.&nbsp; True, it's not Hank Aaron's 
			responsibility, but it's his record, and now it's gone.&nbsp; 
			Asterisk or not, the MLB let Bonds keep playing and will parlay 
			judgment until after retirement.&nbsp; Whatever.</p>
			<p><br>
			<b>I have a few more things</b> to say, but the hour grows late and 
			my penchant for typing decreases with each passing minute.&nbsp; 
			That, and I really should pace myself and save a few articles for 
			the weekend, when I actually have time for the Web site.&nbsp; 
			Thanks for dropping by, and if the tone of the blog seems somewhat 
			somber, I apologize.&nbsp; We've hit the home stretch of summer and 
			I have a large vacation approaching, so my mind is elsewhere.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>As always, the <a href="../blogspot.htm">Moblah'g</a> stands ready 
			to satisfy your cravings for daily reading.&nbsp; Head on over!&nbsp;
