			<p>It appears to be Friday again.&nbsp; It also appears that today's 
			entry just might stink.</p>
			<p>To avoid this unfortunate outcome, I will try my hardest to 
			concoct a literary masterpiece.&nbsp; Mind you, this doesn't happen 
			all the time, and I guarantee you it won't generally transpire on 
			Fridays.&nbsp; Heaven knows I need these days for myself.</p>
			<p>However, I have submitted this site to many search engines this 
			week, and if the happy circumstance presents itself where I actually 
			receive visitors because of those efforts, well then; I better do a 
			quality check.</p>
			<p>This morning, I awoke with the strangest of thoughts in my head.&nbsp; 
			I do not remember if I was dreaming about this particular topic or 
			not, I simply woke up thinking this: </p>
			<p><i>America Online asking me to come back to them is like my 
			middle school asking me to redo 7th and 8th grade.</i></p>
			<p>What's even more ridiculous is that I actually pondered this 
			thought well into my day at work.&nbsp; I was mainly trying to 
			remember something that simply didn't exist anymore, or maybe never 
			did.</p>
			<p>And I'd really like to say that I've put this thought to rest, 
			but no.&nbsp; I'm still turning this thought over in my mind.&nbsp; 
			I've actually (and pathetically)&nbsp; placed some truth into this 
			statement, too.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I figure that America Online was my stepping stone into the 
			Internet.&nbsp; I'm so far gone from those bright snappy icons and 
			parental controls, that every time I receive one of those &lt;costly&gt; 
			CDs in the mail, I shudder.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>&quot;Why, for Pete's sake, would I want to return to you?&quot; </p>
			<p>&quot;Because we're <i>optimized</i>&quot;</p>
			<p>Optimized for what?&nbsp; Faster, superior cleaning action?&nbsp; 
			Increased fuel efficiency?&nbsp; Simplified degradation of extreme 
			variables?&nbsp; What?</p>
			<p><b>STOP. SENDING. ME. THOSE. COME. BACK. CDS.&nbsp; </b>You 
			have now delved into the realm of
			<a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/mispelledword">
			unrememberable</a> REM sessions.&nbsp; That's simply too far.</p>
			<p>Again, I seem to have hit a tangent.&nbsp; Anyway, Wife and I are 
			into our....17th week of the pregnancy, and Monday will mark the 
			18th.&nbsp; I still don't really remember the previous, thank you.&nbsp; 
			I'd like to try again, maybe this time, remembering a few moments 
			here and there.</p>
			<p>Well, that's it for now.&nbsp; If I don't come back tonight to 
			write more, make sure and have a pleasant weekend.&nbsp; </p>

			<p>Maybe tonight, I should write my entry <i><b>before</b></i> I 
			work on my Web site for four hours...</p>
			<p>On my way home from work today, I had the rare experience of jet 
			skiing the entire way.&nbsp; It must have rained at least an inch 
			throughout the time when I was at work, so the streets were flooded, 
			as was my apartment parking lot.</p>
			<p>I have a scooter that gets me to and from work (what's that?&nbsp; 
			Shut yo mouth) and I found it terribly enjoyable to tear through the 
			water in it tonight.&nbsp; As my back tire left a wake behind me, I 
			didn't even give a second glance to find out if I splashed any 
			unfortunate on-looker.</p>
			<p>The funny thing is that kids love that scooter.&nbsp; I can't 
			remember how many times those little tikes have asked me if they 
			could ride it.&nbsp; Sure, kids.&nbsp; Go ask your mom.</p>
			<p>Yoinks.&nbsp; Gone.</p>
			<p>Can't really remember where I was going with this, but I'll try 
			writing more later.</p>
			<p><b>
			<font color="#003366" face="Tahoma" size="2">11/13/03 @ 11:55pm</font></b></p>
			<p>
			Well, that was a huge failure.&nbsp; If there is one thing that I 
			have learned from writing these on a nightly basis, it's this:&nbsp; 
			If you have nothing to say, don't keep typing.</p>
			<p>
			Good day to you all!</p>

			<p>Much less to come tonight, I'm afraid...</p>
			<p>It's a fine thing that I don't promise much.&nbsp; I read a few 
			of my previous entries from over a year ago, and I tended to wax 
			toward unfulfilled promises a bit.&nbsp; Nearly every weekend, I 
			swore to post pictures of my adventures, only to come back empty 
			handed.</p>
			<p>But that may change, as I hope to get a new digital camera for 
			Christmas.&nbsp; The empty promises strike back!</p>
			<p>Today crawled by, however the final hour of work was the worst 
			part.&nbsp; It was one of those days when you looked at the clock 
			and swore that it hadn't progressed at all.&nbsp; It even appeared 
			to have taken turns at the opposite direction.</p>
			<p>Yet the days can inch by like weeks, because the weeks are 
			speeding along like days.&nbsp; I fear that one morning, I shall 
			awaken in cold sweats.&nbsp; I'll check the calendar, and realize 
			it's only April 18th.&nbsp; You see where I'm going with this one.</p>
			<p>So, we needn't go there again.</p>
			<p>Wow, <a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/nopagehere.htm">
			speelcheker</a> didn't go bananas over the word &quot;needn't&quot;.&nbsp; Is 
			that truly a word?&nbsp; I love English.&nbsp; Maybe I'll teach it 
			someday?</p>
			<p>Have a good day!&nbsp; Less tomorrow?&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; More 
			tomorrow. (not a promise)</p>

			<p>Complete comfort.&nbsp; What does it consist of, exactly?</p>
			<p>Is it a song, played at the perfect time?&nbsp; Or is it a 
			picture of familiar place, long forgotten, but easily remembered?&nbsp; 
			How about a mother's touch?&nbsp; Is it anything deeper or slight?</p>
			<p>No one can quite know the answer to this question.&nbsp; However, 
			comfort is a <br>
			feeling that I experience quite often now.&nbsp; And, not only do I 
			feel this tangible device, but I can see it in my wife's eyes.&nbsp; 
			I can smell it when I enter my <br>
			home.&nbsp; I hear it when I listen to my music.&nbsp; And, I can 
			see it when I cast <br>
			my eyes to heaven.</p>
			<p>It's not something that I've completely missed, now that I ponder 
			upon it.&nbsp; <br>
			I felt once that love was something that I was missing all along, 
			and that <br>
			may be true in one certain aspect, for I have never tasted love like 
			I have now.</p>
			<p>But now I know love was something that was coursing through me 
			daily.&nbsp; It superseded everything I knew, it comforted me along 
			the way.&nbsp; Have I completed the circle?&nbsp; I doubt it.</p>
			<p>I'm not four and a half month's away from life's event horizon; 
			my child will be born.&nbsp; It many ways, it still scares me and 
			gives me great hope, never before <br>
			did I believe that something could pave the way for such conflicting 
			emotion.&nbsp; <br>
			I'm excited and yet drawn inward.&nbsp; I'm cautious, yet reflected 
			outward.&nbsp; It's an emotional contradiction in every sense of the 
			meaning.</p>
			<p>But I love it, I crave it.&nbsp; I wish I could document and 
			savor every emotion felt during this time in my life, because I know 
			that experiences like these often <br>
			pass by too fast.&nbsp; And when I want to turn back and relive 
			them, I realize <br>
			that I have too much to accomplish here and now.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I'm sure that it will only increase as time progresses. </p>
			<p>Well, that's it for now.&nbsp; I've worked tirelessly on getting 
			the <a href="../index.htm">Professional</a> portion of my Web site 
			completely operational, and I believe that I'm about 99% there.&nbsp; 
			I'll leave the remaining percent as constant motivation to work on 
			it.</p>
			<p>Have a great day.&nbsp; Go get a <a href="OldPages/mail.htm">free e-mail 
			address</a>, will you?</p>

			<p>It was a welcome transition from the rest of the weekend.&nbsp; I 
			won't go into great detail, primarily because I wouldn't want to 
			relive the exhausting parts, even in my mind.&nbsp; Suffice it to 
			say that Friday and Saturday were very, very odd.</p>
			<p>Odd:&nbsp; Now that's a nice descriptor!</p>
			<p>The picture up there; that's our cat.&nbsp; I will never, ever 
			devote even a single page to the silly kitten, because I don't want 
			to come off as a crazy nut who carries their cat in a backpack.&nbsp; 
			But dang, that's a cool pose, and I hope he was dreaming about mice.</p>
			<p>Or catnip.&nbsp; He likes that stuff.</p>
			<p>I think he slept for like, 20 hours today.&nbsp; Right now, he's 
			just cleaning himself, because all that slumber must have made him 
			filthy.&nbsp; My brother told me to not feel sorry for him, ever: He 
			said that cats have a knack at making themselves seem deprived and 
			lowly.&nbsp; That said, Dobby is one of the best.</p>
			<p>Enough about the silly cat.&nbsp; Wife is fine, house is fine.&nbsp; 
			Car still runs great, though it sounds like a helicopter at 
			lift-off. (literary licence: I've actually never heard a live 
			helicopter, let alone one during lift-off)&nbsp; However, Wife and I 
			feel that the Copter gives an accurate description of the sounds 
			that it generates when we drive away.</p>
			<p>Other than that, I delve into the coming week in happier spirits 
			than the last, the promise of Friday being pay day does an amazing 
			job of making me smile.&nbsp; And I should never forget that I have 
			the best wife in the world.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>By the way, we're into week 17 of the pregnancy now.&nbsp; That's 
			what, 4 months now?&nbsp; Isn't this about the time that I should 
			start preparing for the child?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; I wonder if 
			he/she will ever read any of this...I'll be willing to bet that it 
			will give a definite good look into my head during this time of 
			transition.</p>
			<p>This entry is turning quickly into blather.&nbsp; I really need 
			to go to bed, anyway.&nbsp; Like I said earlier, it's been an odd 
			weekend...</p>
