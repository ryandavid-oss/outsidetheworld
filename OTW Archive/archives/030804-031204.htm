			<b>Only a quick </b>entry tonight.&nbsp; It's been a long day - 
			again - and I'm looking forward to hitting the sack.&nbsp; The baby 
			shower was a success, or so I heard.&nbsp; I wasn't there, I skipped 
			out quietly as the guests arrived.&nbsp; The baby boy got quite a 
			few neat things, he should be very happy once he arrives.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			My wife found it amazing how such a small thing could need so much 
			stuff.&nbsp; As I looked around at the treasure trove of items, I 
			knew she was right.&nbsp; From clothes to bathing supplies, this kid 
			needs a lot of consumables.&nbsp; Something tells me he'll be more 
			than worth it all though.</p>
			<p>
			We're heading to the Jazz-Suns game tomorrow night.&nbsp; Here's 
			hoping that it's a good game.&nbsp; You all know who I want to win.</p>

			<font color="#003366"><b>03/11/04</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<b>English lessons<font color="#003366">.&nbsp; </font></b>As a rule 
			of thumb, you should never try and persuade rules of writing without 
			proper research.&nbsp; My wife taught me this important lesson 
			earlier tonight.&nbsp; It turns out that I may know something about 
			writing, but I have a difficult time expressing where I learned it 
			from.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			It all started when I asked her to make sure and proof this Blog for 
			me, as she is usually the first to read it.&nbsp; She told me she 
			would, and already had something in mind.&nbsp; She pointed out a 
			good one.&nbsp; Yesterday, I quoted Kobe Bryant as saying &quot;just not 
			right.&quot;&nbsp; For good reason, she told me to take the period out of 
			the quotes and end the sentence on the outside of the statement.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			But sometime ago, I learned that commas and periods remain inside of 
			the statement at the end of a sentence, and exclamation points and 
			question marks are placed on the outside.&nbsp; She proceeded to 
			take out her Psychology book to show me several examples of period 
			usage outside of the quotes.</p>
			<p>
			Unsurprisingly, I became flustered because I felt that years of 
			habit were crumbling before me.&nbsp; Not willing to give up, I 
			googled the phrase, &quot;quotation mark and period usage&quot; and
			<a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~wbecker1/style/punctuation.html">
			found the following page</a>.&nbsp; I wouldn't necessarily declare 
			victory, as success is generally derived from hardened dedication.&nbsp; 
			I'd give the victory straight to her, as her quiet patience taught 
			me a lesson, as always.&nbsp; What a girl.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Star Trek II.&nbsp; </b>After the results of the previous Star 
			Trek viewing, I had cast off all thought of my wife agreeing to 
			watch any further installments of this series.&nbsp; But we did end up 
			watching the second film tonight, and it made me remember that this 
			one was probably my favorite.&nbsp; The story of Khan is excellent, 
			and there was enough plausible drama to keep us both entertained for 
			the entire movie.&nbsp; Gone were the long segments of elaborate 
			homecoming; instead, the entirety was driven by the storyline.&nbsp; 
			But I'll pass on the full review for tonight.&nbsp; I'm much too 
			tired for that.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Baby shower tomorrow.&nbsp; </b>It's hard to believe that we've 
			come this far already, the preparations seemed so far off for this 
			event.&nbsp; I've distanced myself pretty well from the occasion, 
			partly out of jealously, mainly out of frustration.&nbsp; But I'm 
			sure that the wife will have a great time, and she sure deserves all 
			the neat things she'll undoubtedly get.&nbsp; I'll be sure to list a 
			few of the more memorable items tomorrow, as the week is retiring 
			quickly and I'm running out of material.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Until then, keep the fire hot.&nbsp; We'll see you again.</p>

			<p>
			<b><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4490526/">Kobe says the Jazz 
			are out of the picture</a></b>.&nbsp; Too bad he doesn't understand 
			that they don't want him anyway.&nbsp; If the Jazz front office ever 
			expressed interest in him, not only would I be surprised, but I'd be 
			willing to bet their offer was extremely modest.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			You know what an exceptional organization looks for when they sign 
			players?&nbsp; It's not just talent.&nbsp; It's not the experience, 
			the rings, or the publicity.&nbsp; It's the character of the man 
			himself, and Kobe hasn't got it.&nbsp; He bemoans the Jazz 
			organization because their skit involving him was &quot;just not right.&quot;&nbsp; 
			He was quoted as saying that he was angry because the skit made fun 
			of Karl Malone.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; I believe he was upset 
			because the skit exposed him a little bit more than he found 
			comfortable.</p>
			<p>
			He stated that events such as the skit on January 24th must be taken 
			into consideration when choosing teams.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when 
			you A. Have been charged with rape and B. Continue to care about 
			your pocketbook above winning, it does not reflect well when 
			pursuing another team.</p>
			<p>
			The media and press state that the Jazz &quot;poked fun&quot; at his legal 
			troubles.&nbsp; Regretfully for Kobe, this digs much deeper than 
			sheer legalities.&nbsp; If convicted, he could face years of prison 
			and/or a life-time of probation.&nbsp; He has to rebuild his 
			carefully crafted image from the ruins that he himself created.&nbsp; 
			I&nbsp; wonder why he doesn't watch his words more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			In my opinion, he has an insurmountable task ahead of him.&nbsp; He 
			may be acquitted,&nbsp; he may continue to play basketball at a 
			level others envy, but he will never, ever earn the respect of 
			millions again.</p>
			<p>
			So why devote so much space to this?&nbsp; Because to me, this type 
			of stuff matters.&nbsp; It's just another compass for the way the 
			world turns, another drop in the bucket that has overflowed.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Phew.&nbsp; </b>Sorry about that.&nbsp; In the future, I will 
			give ample warning when entering extreme screed mode.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>Camping.&nbsp; Again.</b>&nbsp; Over the last weekend, I went on 
			another camping trip with some buddies of mine.&nbsp; This time, we 
			didn't forget the firewood, and we even brought charcoal briquettes 
			and a load of mesquite chips for a bit of flavor.&nbsp; My oh my, 
			steak does taste better when not prepared over a bustling flame of 
			dura-log.</p>
			<p>
			Alas, this may be my last trip for a while, as the time draws ever 
			nearer for the birth of our son.&nbsp; In five weeks, life will 
			change dramatically.&nbsp; In the meantime, I had better set things 
			straight around the res' and spend as much time with my wife as 
			possible.&nbsp; I don't feel oppressed by the pending arrival; 
			however, there comes a point when you finally realize there never 
			was a point to turn back.&nbsp; The implications of the 
			responsibility of a child are astounding, at best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Everyday I think quietly to myself.&nbsp; Everyday I find myself 
			more drawn to this person that I have never known.&nbsp; Everyday I 
			become more of a father, and the boy inside of me is transferred to 
			the soul inside my wife's belly.&nbsp; At first, it was an unwilling 
			process, fraught with tears and confusion.&nbsp; Now, it's more of 
			an honor.&nbsp; Expectations are that this young boy will soon be my 
			son.&nbsp; Aspirations are a great deal higher.</p>
			<p>
			That's it for now.&nbsp; I decided to write this entry a little 
			early tonight so as to grant myself a little more free time to 
			pursue other venues.&nbsp; I may return later tonight, but 
			most likely not.&nbsp; Regardless, I'll be doing the same thing for 
			the foreseeable future, like it or not.&nbsp; Cheers!</p>
			<p>
			<font color="#003366"><b>03/10/04 @9:28pm.&nbsp; </b></font>
			Honestly, I didn't expect to return tonight.&nbsp; But while what I 
			have to say is brief, I couldn't keep it for tomorrow's entry.&nbsp; 
			I just went for a ride around the adjoining neighborhoods on the ol' 
			scooter.&nbsp; I love this time of year.&nbsp; Every scent is 
			enhanced and magnified by the cool night air.&nbsp; I don't feel a 
			rush to get inside to warm up; instead, I can keep my head up as I 
			stroll about outside.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I even caught a hint of some orange blossoms in the area.&nbsp; 
			That's an event that has become less and less common, I'm afraid.&nbsp; 
			It used to be that everywhere you went, you could inhale the heady 
			aroma of the nearby orange groves.&nbsp; Now, you must make due with 
			the occasional orange tree.&nbsp; But it still smells great.</p>
			<p>
			This time of year is what living in Arizona is all about.</p>

			<b>As it's still</b> my birthday, I'll make this a brief entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The wife and I ran all around town today, having all sorts of fun, 
			and now we're ready to collapse for a few hours.&nbsp; But I won't 
			leave you all empty handed, oh no.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			What I have for you today is a <a href="../video/chicken.wmv">video</a>.&nbsp; 
			To clarify, a video of a chicken.&nbsp; Yes yes, I know.&nbsp; I 
			beat things to death.&nbsp; But I figure that when you have a theme, 
			you ought to go with it.&nbsp; It seems that the chicken was still 
			around when we got home last night, even though promises were made 
			for its safe retrieval.&nbsp; For all I know, the poor guy is still 
			cluckin' about outside, wondering how he got to be in this 
			predicament.&nbsp; He seemed to be quite worried when I approached 
			him, to tell the truth.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			So what was the prize for today?&nbsp; The ultimate gift had to be 
			the Star Trek box set.&nbsp; That completes the collection at ten 
			DVDs.&nbsp; That's pretty happy news.&nbsp; We sat down last night 
			to watch the first one.&nbsp; My wife had of course never seen the 
			earlier Treks, and it had been quite a few years since I had viewed 
			it, save maybe the last few minutes on some cable channel.&nbsp; The 
			only word I have to describe that first installment is <i>odd</i>.&nbsp; 
			Such a strange, odd show.&nbsp; I like it, but there is just so much 
			pomp and non-climatic chorus.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			As I explained (or tried) to my wife, this movie arrived years after 
			the final episode of the television series, so they intended the 
			seven minute sequence of Kirk and Scotty soaring around the new 
			Enterprise to be somewhat of a touching moment.&nbsp; But now, 
			watching the movie in 2004, it all feels a bit hokey, like they're 
			making too much of a deal about the reunion and such.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			You want to push the fast forward button to the action parts, but 
			the movie is meant to be cerebral and platonic.&nbsp; Needless 
			today, we're moving right along to the latter movies with greater 
			anticipation.</p>
			<p>
			<b>So that's it.&nbsp; </b>The birthday is at an end, and by what I 
			hear outside of my office window, the neighbors have reported that 
			the chicken has taken roost just beyond their front porch.&nbsp; 
			That's fine, as he had previously staked out the seat of my scooter 
			as his new home.&nbsp; He decided against it.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Perhaps he found it too familiar.....</p>

			<b>So, chickens can climb stairs</b>.&nbsp; We were awoken this 
			morning by some peculiar and rare news.&nbsp; My wife seemed to 
			think it was mildly amusing, but if she only knew the quickening 
			pace of my heart when she told me, she would have instantly known 
			that she made my day.</p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="../pics/chicken.jpg" width="212" height="353" align="left">There 
			was a rooster out in our front yard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the only 
			reason that I got excited was because it was genuine camera fodder, 
			for there is blessed little to capture around an urban apartment 
			complex.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The neighborhood kids were thrilled with delight; there were a few 
			of them who were set on the idea of catching this lost bird.&nbsp; 
			But I could remember from my summer in Ephraim, Utah that it's not 
			really possible to capture one of these birds without a little bit 
			of formal training.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The older neighbors were abuzz.&nbsp; It seems we don't get much 
			excitement around here, eh?&nbsp; The apartment staff was there too, 
			walkie-talkies in hand, wondering what to do about this rogue farm 
			animal.&nbsp; Luckily, one of the girls that worked at the office 
			had a husband that knew a thing or two about these birds, and 
			actually raised a few hundred in his life.&nbsp; So he came straight 
			over to get it.&nbsp; That's fine, because I was growing weary of my 
			neighbors jokes about a chicken dinner.&nbsp; </p>

			<p>
			<b>In other news</b>:&nbsp; It's birthday time, and I have the day 
			off.&nbsp; It's time to go shopping.&nbsp; The wife got me some 
			neat-o presents this morning, including a much-coveted propane 
			lantern.&nbsp; How'd she know that I wanted that?&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; 
			She's the best.&nbsp; She also left early in the morning to get me 
			my birthday cereal.&nbsp; That is simply a tradition that cannot 
			die.&nbsp; Although it appears now that other families have jumped 
			on that wagon, as my wife came home with a box of &quot;Birthday Trix&quot;.&nbsp; 
			When I sat down at my desk to scribble off this entry, I was also 
			greeted with an e-mail from my brother, wishing me a happy day with 
			a Pay Pal present in tow. What a wonderful start to a wonderful 
			morning.</p>
			<p>
			Poultry and sugared cereal, propane lanterns and active Pay Pal 
			accounts.&nbsp; What a day.&nbsp; See you tomorrow!</p>
