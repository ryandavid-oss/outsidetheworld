			<p>Finally, Friday is upon us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's unique signature is 
			visible upon the week's horizon.</p>
			<p>This week, I have provided you with a different snapshot every 
			day.&nbsp; Well, I don't have a new one today.&nbsp; I just couldn't 
			muster it.&nbsp; So instead, I have delved into my treasure chest of 
			old pictures to give you this:</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/santa2.jpg" width="229" height="360"></p>
			<p>I got this a couple of years ago from my elder brother.&nbsp; He 
			usually had this threatening picture of Saint Nick up on his 
			refrigerator door, and he had some sort of clever caption, written 
			by himself, affixed somewhere nearby.</p>
			<p>Oh yes, I believe it went something like, &quot;Only good little girls 
			and boys get to know what's in Santa's pipe&quot;.</p>
			<p>Well, it's paraphrased, anyway.&nbsp; I'm sure my brother will 
			write me tomorrow and let me know what it really said.&nbsp; And 
			now, it's made its way on the the old Net.&nbsp; What do you think 
			about that, eh?</p>
			<p>Well, this week was my gift to you.&nbsp; And now, it's at an 
			end.&nbsp; Sorry about the short entry today. It's been a long day, 
			after all.&nbsp; Have a great weekend, and I'll see you back here on 
			Monday. (or Sunday night, for all you blogjumpers out there) </p>

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/11/03</font></b></p>
			<p>Greetings on this fine Thursday.&nbsp; Warning:&nbsp; Extreme 
			laziness today.&nbsp; Not much below.</p>
			<p>Today, I had a day off.&nbsp; It was needed because I had a 
			doctor's appointment to attend to at 4:00pm.&nbsp; Too bad, because 
			I forgot about it entirely.&nbsp; My wife had to remind me about it 
			about a gazillion times, (special note, gazillion also appears to be 
			acceptable to Word's spellchecker) and I still forgot.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Now, something for the rest of you.&nbsp; MSNBC has a neat
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/987180.asp">Digital IQ</a> test.&nbsp; 
			I took it, wife did too, as did my brother and parents.&nbsp; Go 
			ahead and take that test and then come back here.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I won't tell you what I got, as that is unimportant in this case.&nbsp; 
			And the fact of the matter is that it's entirely lop-sided on the 
			downward cycle.&nbsp; If you haven't got a home network or if you 
			don't know what bluetooth is, then you're in for a rough time.</p>
			<p>Many MSNBC readers who completed this IQ test sent its creator a 
			word or two.&nbsp; I found the following entry quite amusing:</p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			<b>Name: Ryan<br>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hometown: Mesa, Ariz.</b></font></i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			<br>
			Just like stereotypical nerds, the people who aren’t scoring high 
			get all flustered and upset because it strips them of their geekness 
			— the only thing that they have.</font></i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			Digital IQ isn’t about who sets up the most elaborate wireless 
			network ... it’s also about knowledge of Internet culture. Teen Girl 
			Squad, anyone? (Kudos if you know what this is)</font></i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			As for the “Web site designer” who says you suck for not using 
			Mozilla ... he suffers from typical hypergeekism. To mimic the years 
			of abuse from their peers in grade school, they continue to abuse 
			themselves by using outdated and/or inferior technology so they can 
			be L33T. </font></i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			They love to make everything difficult. “Ha? Use an FTP Client? I do 
			all my work command-line. Outlook? Are you crazy? I spent a few 
			weeks writing my own JAVA app for that. I might share it with people 
			on my Website. Check it out — new messages are in 0000FF.” </font>
			</i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			And don’t get me started on the “OMG, I HATE OFFICE AND MICROSOFT. Y 
			R U USING IT, N00B???” people.</font></i></p>
			<p><i>
			<font face="Times New Roman, Georgia, Times" color="#000000" size="2">
			For the record, I got 120 on the quiz. Again, its more about culture 
			than engineering, n00bz. </font></i></p>
			<p>I simply found that refreshing.&nbsp; If you missed the Web site 
			above, you can find that
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/987180.asp">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Anyway.&nbsp; (do I say that too often?) Since I've provided you 
			readers with a different picture every day of this week, I had 
			better stick with the program and fuzz you another cam-shot.</p>
			<p><font color="#FF0000">Run phone_pictures.exe</font>:

			<p>Is this a house aflame?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; It's just my fuzzy

			<p>No tricks tonight, just great news.</p>
			<p>We finally know what it is.&nbsp; After weeks of waiting, Wife 
			and I had our second ultrasound to determine the gender of our baby.&nbsp; 
			We awoke early, around <br>
			6:00am, as our appointment time was at 7:00 
			and we needed to be there early.</p>
			<p>When we arrived, the sun was barely rising over the eastern 
			mountains.&nbsp; There was a definite chill in the air as I led her 
			up to the building.&nbsp; We were both <br>
			excited, but neither of us 
			wanted to admit that we were nervous, too.</p>
			<p>When we walked into the doctor's office, I asked the receptionist 
			if we should proceed directly to the ultrasound or wait here for the 
			doctor.</p>
			<p>&quot;You don't have an ultrasound scheduled for today, I'm afraid&quot;, 
			she said.</p>
			<p>I then informed her that there must have been some mistake, as 
			the doctor <br>
			told us that he would make sure we found out during the 
			next appointment.&nbsp; <br>
			She was very stern with me, and told me that 
			there was no possible way <br>
			that we could have our ultrasound today.</p>
			<p>Heartbroken, we took our seats in the lobby and waited for the 
			doctor to call <br>
			us in.&nbsp; My wife didn't say a word, but the look 
			in her eyes told me exactly <br>
			how she felt.&nbsp; The poor thing was 
			heartbroken!</p>
			<p>Anyway, when we talked to the doctor, he informed us that he 
			would work his magic and make sure we were scheduled in at 8:00am 
			for the ultrasound.&nbsp; <br>
			Pure excitement! </p>
			<p>We waited another hour, watching the Today show on the television 
			in the lobby.&nbsp; It must have done a great job of distracting me, 
			because I didn't feel nervous <br>
			again until they called my wife's 
			name.</p>
			<p>We walked together back into the ultrasound room, holding hands 
			and breaths.&nbsp; <br>
			I nervously asked the nurse if she thought that we'd be able to know 
			what it <br>
			was, she reassured us that we should have no problem finding out.</p>
			<p>As she touched the wand to my wife's tummy, I glanced at the tiny 
			screen to the side of us.&nbsp; I watched in wonder as this tiny 
			being rolled around inside my wife.&nbsp; &quot;Just get to the good 
			part&quot;, I said to myself.&nbsp; I had hardly thought this when I 
			realized I should be enjoying this moment, I should really 
			experience the whole thing, and not just the 
			penultimate moment.</p>
			<p>Well, that moment finally came.&nbsp; She told us what it was, and we both 
			looked at each other knowingly.&nbsp; We both knew it from the 
			start, yet we were still so surprised and happy.&nbsp; Basically, 
			any positive and wholesome emotion was felt at that moment in time.</p>
			<p>So, just four little months left.&nbsp; We await his arrival with 
			great anticipation.</p>
			<p align="center">

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/09/03</font></b></p>
			<p>Hah, well...I tricked you.</p>
			<p>That's the problem.&nbsp; You see, I didn't intentionally mislead 
			you.&nbsp; The date you <br>
			see affixed to this entry is in fact the day when Wife and I learn 
			more about our new child.&nbsp; But the problem lies in the fact 
			that I always (generally, can I say <br>
			that?) write these entries on the night before.</p>
			<p>So that means the smashing update that I promised simply has not 
			yet occurred. </p>
			<p>Bummer.&nbsp; So, that means another short space of time for 
			readers to wait.&nbsp; <br>
			But rest assured, I will most likely not make you wait until 
			Wednesday <br>
			morning to learn of the news.&nbsp; I'll set to it right when I get 
			home from the appointment.</p>
			<p>The wind is howling outside tonight.&nbsp; It started to really 
			kick up when I left for lunch earlier today.&nbsp; It's hardly a 
			good thing when the vehicle you use weighs slightly less than you 
			do.&nbsp; It's a remarkably good thing that I only have to <br>
			wander across the street on that scooter.&nbsp; Which, by the way, 
			my friend is interested in purchasing.&nbsp; That would be a boon, 
			says I.</p>
			<p>So where was I.&nbsp; Oh yes, the wind.&nbsp; It actually makes 
			it feel a tad bit wintry outside.&nbsp; That does make me feel 
			better, as earlier this month, Mr. <br>
			Weatherman informed Arizona viewers that this month's weather would 
			be unseasonably hot.&nbsp; Not warm, mind you, but hot.&nbsp; That's 
			simply not the <br>
			way that anyone wishes to begin their holiday season, especially 
			someone <br>
			like me, who at one point in his life, viewed ten feet of snow piled 
			outside <br>
			his bedroom window on any given morning.</p>
			<p>Well, we take what we can get here in the land of the sun.</p>
			<p>16 days till Christmas.&nbsp; Might I recommend a gifts for you 
			and yours?</p>

			you have to draw upon the comedic prowess of your feline companion 
			to keep your blog afloat on any given day.&nbsp; Today, my 
			friends...is simply not going to be one of those days.</p>
			<p>Good day to you.&nbsp; I'll see you tomorrow. (or less!)</p>

			<p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#003366">12/08/03</font></b></p>
			<p>Ahem, a new week.</p>
			<p>This weekend was enjoyable, I must say.&nbsp; Wife and I got to 
			spend some time with a few friends of ours.&nbsp; We ate at their 
			place and then headed to Mesa to view the Mesa Arizona temple 
			lights.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>It was beautiful, as it always is.&nbsp; However this year, there 
			seemed to be a few more lights around than usual.&nbsp; In fact, I 
			was going to place a picture of the lights here on the site, but 
			with my poor camera phone, it made the Christmas lights appear as if 
			they were fire, and every tree around the temple grounds was 
			engulfed in flames.</p>
			<p>As you peruse the site this week, you'll be happy to note that 
			the <a href="../photography.htm">Media</a> page has finally been updated.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Go visit when you have a chance.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>There's a few pictures there, one poor song, and the hope of a 
			lot more content in the coming month.&nbsp; Please, please keep in 
			mind one thing:&nbsp; I don't know too much about photography, I 
			simply like taking pictures of random scenery too much.&nbsp; It'll 
			get better, I promise.&nbsp; I haven't had a decent camera in ages.</p>
			<p>I also changed the front page picture, but I'm still trying to 
			get used to it.&nbsp; Maybe I was just too attached to the other 
			one.</p>
			<p>No shopping trips this weekend, though.&nbsp; No money this time 
			around.&nbsp; We'll hit the stores as soon as Friday rolls around.&nbsp; 
			Oh, that reminds me.&nbsp; We have a train around our tree now.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="../pics/6974068613.jpg" width="352" height="288"></p>
			<p>There you go, have a fuzzy picture, compliments of Sanyo.</p>
			<p>It's one of the greatest things to have during the holidays.&nbsp; 
			I highly recommend it.&nbsp; In fact, if you don't have one, start a 
			fund, go shopping, look around, go nuts.&nbsp; Just make sure yours 
			doesn't play a high-pitched &quot;Christmas Favourite&quot; as the box 
			mentioned.&nbsp; Yeah, that's how the manufacturer spelled favorite.&nbsp; 
			They must correlate Christmas time with Merry Olde England.&nbsp; 
			And who doesn't?&nbsp; <a href="../pics/disney.gif">Disney sure does</a>.</p>
			<p>And that's it.&nbsp; No more for today, says I.&nbsp; Have a 
			great week, we'll see you tomorrow.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Oh yes, you know what tomorrow is.</p>
