			<b>Saturday, January 26, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			It finally happened.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I completely let the blog slip my mind last night. Grim. I figure 
			that I'm allowed at least one miss, if not by works, then surely by 
			grace. Yesterday was a terribly slow one at work, I think everyone 
			must have left quietly during lunch, for when I came back from my 
			own mid day snack, there wasn't much to behold upon arrival. I 
			suppose I can blame the absence of several employees one of the four 
			letter words in my vocabulary: Golf. Yup, I'm gonna go swing a stick 
			atta ball and i figger I might not make it back today. Golf really 
			isn't that bad, I guess. It's just not my forté. I tried it once and 
			my eyes were so swollen from the grass or the pollen or the lack of 
			real exercise that I just had to stop. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Today I went on a group date to the local rock climbing gym. I wish 
			that I could have taken pictures, it's a really great looking place. 
			Once upon a time, I climbed a lot. Now, 2 years later, I realize 
			that I'm not so hot at it. By the end of the day I was so tired and 
			my hands gave up. They're still putting up a fierce fight, must be 
			why this entry is taking four-score months to type. I'm also pert 
			exhausted, and I have almost complete lack of motor skills. Ho hum. 
			There hasn't been any real concrete work done to the site so far 
			this weekend, but perhaps tomorrow or next weekend. I wish to make 
			it a more aesthetic experience for all. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I hope everyone has an enjoyable rest of the weekend, back to the 
			grind soon enough, eh?<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Aye.<br>

			<br>
			So, I woke up sick this morning...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I hate that feeling that you get when you first wake up. You know 
			the one I'm talking about, when your chest feels like your bed 
			decided to lay on you halfway through the night? Yeah, that one. I 
			have this interminable cough that just won't leave me alone. Sure, 
			it takes vacations every once in a while, but apparently it got 
			tired of wherever it was the past few weeks and is here to curse my 
			life again. So I ended up not going into work today, which in and of 
			itself isn't bad, but tomorrow I know I'll wake up feeling even 
			worse, and then I won't want to call in sick because then I look 
			like a pansy. You should never ever call in sick the first day you 
			feel bad. I think it should be a rule.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Well, our ward did play our first basketball game tonight, and we 
			won 64-44. Twas an excellent game. I think one poor old guy ruptured 
			his Achilles tendon right when the game started though. The first 
			rule when you are 50 years old and trying to play with kids half 
			your age has been and always will be: Stretch. So anyway.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Krystal ....this is your paragraph, Your very own paragraph on my 
			little silly-site. Now, don't go saying I don't care about you. And 
			to all the rest of my friends in Provo, Marci, Cat, Britney, Sarah, 
			Janelle, John, you must be included in Krystal's paragraph too. I 
			hope all is well in BYU town.<br>
			<br>

			Carpe Diem.<br>

			I'm sorry to report that I have severe writer's block tonight. Too 
			much and not enough on my mind, I suppose! Tomorrow our ward does 
			have its first basketball game, and most likely I will write about 
			that tomorrow. Keep up the good work, everybody. Tchau.<br>

			Surely I can think of something to write.....<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Today I got to go out on the job site to look at manhole covers. 
			Yep, beautiful, beautiful manhole covers...It was quite the 
			experience, really. I learned that every step you take is about 3 
			feet long, and therefore I had to dust off the old brain and divide 
			foot measurements by 3's. That was a tough one, but what made it 
			worse was that I had to walk while I was dividing. I actually had to 
			stop once, pause, divide 3 into some insanely easy number like 140 
			and then keep walking. For some reason, the number &quot;7&quot; wouldn't 
			leave my mind. Uh huh, three must go into 140 seven times. Math is 
			just not my gig. But honestly, you'd think that I could divide, for 
			cryin' out loud...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			But thank goodness I still have basketball. It's one of those rare 
			beauties I have in life that makes me feel great afterward. Even 
			when I lose, I still feel like I knew what I was doing.* Tonight I 
			also asked this girl in my institute class on a date. Now, all I 
			need is ideas. No more bagel dates. There can be only one of those, 
			I'm 'fraid. Oh, and I'm sure that Adam Dawson will appreciate this 
			one: Sleep America...where America goes TO sleep&quot;. Not FOR sleep. 
			You were correct, much to my dismay. For a confirmation of 
			this...please visit their website.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Inside stories. Maybe I shouldn't write them on here...nah.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			*Sshhh, Kevin, quiet, Neal... Your time will undoubtedly come.....<br>
