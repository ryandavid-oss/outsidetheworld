			<b>Only the most twisted</b> of minds substitutes work for work.&nbsp; 
			But that's just what I do, it seems.&nbsp; It's almost a guarantee 
			that I will begin working on this Web site (fun work) when I have a 
			large job-related project to complete over the weekend (other work).</p>
			<p>
			Just how much of my work-related project did I complete this 
			weekend?&nbsp; Not one bit.&nbsp; But in related news, the Web site 
			is coming along just peachy.</p>
			<p>
			<b>A little weekend report </b>seems to be in order, then.&nbsp; 
			Friday night signaled the long drive home from Phoenix to East Mesa, 
			which has been made slightly easier by the discovery of a car pool 
			buddy.&nbsp; Isn't there another word for that?&nbsp; &quot;Buddy&quot; just 
			sounds &quot;chummy&quot;.&nbsp; Which also sounds weird.&nbsp; This paragraph 
			is getting circular.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Again, Friday night signaled the long drive home.&nbsp; How long is 
			it?&nbsp; Long enough.&nbsp; 45 miles, by my estimate.&nbsp; I 
			hardly need an estimate anymore, so I don't know why I said 
			estimate.&nbsp; I know it is exactly 44.6 miles from parking lot to 
			garage.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Friday night meant pizza night, and the best pizza for a broke 
			family is from Little Caesars.&nbsp; Only $5.00 purchases one fine 
			meal.&nbsp; With leftovers!&nbsp; We've also recently discovered the 
			convenience that home-delivered movies brings, courtesy of 
			Blockbuster.&nbsp; So we watched Mythbusters, of course.</p>
			<p>
			Saturday was a jewel of a day.&nbsp; From my friend Kyle, I learned 
			about &quot;Starburys&quot;, a line of shoes only available at
			<a href="http://www.steveandbarrys.com/">Steve and Barry's </a>for 
			only $14.98.&nbsp; A fantastic deal, and not a bad shoe at that.&nbsp; 
			We drove down to the only Steve and Barry's store in the state (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&um=1&q=desert+sky+mall&near=Phoenix,+AZ&fb=1&cid=0,0,3688905900232148494&sa=X&oi=local_result&resnum=1&ct=image">Desert 
			Sky Mall</a>, *shudder*) and met my friend Jordan there.&nbsp; 
			Apparently, I did not let Kyle know what time we were to meet.&nbsp; 
			Go figure.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I bought three pair.&nbsp; My friend bought five.&nbsp; When I went 
			up to the counter to purchase, I was shocked to read the following. 
			&quot;LIMIT 10 PAIRS OF SHOES, PER PERSON, PER DAY.&nbsp; THANK YOU.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Whoa, 10 pairs?&nbsp; Who would buy 10 pairs of shoes at one time?&nbsp; 
			It seemed incredible to me, but then again, I was 1/3 of the way 
			there, and I can imagine myself going back in a few months to pick 
			up some newer styles.</p>
			<p>
			After the purchase, the friends and I met back up at the park to 
			break our shoes in.&nbsp; I smiled to see that the court was empty; 
			we'd have the entire place to ourselves.&nbsp; Which worked out 
			well, since we were all wearing the same shoes and looked a little 
			geeky.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			When I got out of the car, I remembered why the park was empty.&nbsp; 
			It's June, in Arizona, at 1:00pm.&nbsp; It's 103 degrees in the 
			shade.&nbsp; Oh.</p>
			<p>
			But we played on anyway, pleasantly surprised by the quality of the 
			shoes and growling whenever one of us stepped on each other's feet.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The most interesting part of the day occurred while we were shooting 
			around.&nbsp; Two cars pulled up and parked alongside each other for 
			a duration of 10 minutes, one passenger entering the other car for a 
			moment before getting back in his ride and taking off.&nbsp; This 
			repeated two more times with a separate car, so naturally we got 
			curious and began taking notice of the cars and their passengers.</p>
			<p>
			Another 15 minutes went by with all cars leaving, but remaining in 
			the neighborhood, driving by every minute or so.&nbsp; We quickly 
			realized they were waiting for us to leave so that they could have 
			their privacy doing gosh-knows-what.&nbsp; I took a stab at it and 
			figured they were dealing, so I called the cops.&nbsp; We left a 
			moment later, so I don't really know what happened.&nbsp; I don't 
			even know if they were dealing, but it seemed awfully suspicious to 
			me.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Sunday consisted of a few updates to the Web site, and this blog.&nbsp; 
			Oh, and a bike ride.&nbsp; That was fun.&nbsp; My legs feel like 
			stretched bamboo poles, and ambulate much the same.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>So, what's coming up?</b>&nbsp; It's June, which means The Police 
			concert is approaching quickly.&nbsp; The wife also begins working 
			(for free), otherwise known as rotations.&nbsp; Sumner also starts 
			pre-school tomorrow morning.&nbsp; That should be a blast to drop 
			him off for the first time <i>ever</i>.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Wish us luck, we'll need it, eh?&nbsp; See you soon.</p>
