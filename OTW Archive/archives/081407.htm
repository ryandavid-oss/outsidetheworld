			<font size="4" color="#2A6095"><b>08/14/07</b></font><p><b>The 
			monsoon storms </b>seem to have abated for the time, and the 
			temperatures have soared right back up into the unbearable zone.&nbsp; 
			I knew I should have enjoyed the cooler weather while it was here.&nbsp; 
			Though there was a day about a week ago when we had a freakish 
			amount of rain in a short<a href="../pics/IMG_1090.JPG"><img border="2" src="../pics/IMG_1090_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../IMG_1090.JPG" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"></a> 
			time span.&nbsp; I told Sumner to go enjoy it.&nbsp; He had a blast!&nbsp; 
			Too bad daddy had to stand back and take the pictures though.&nbsp; 
			That's always the trade off: enjoy the moment or archive the 
			memories.&nbsp; I chose the latter.</p>
			<p>I came the the conclusion earlier tonight that I ought to enjoy 
			my time more fully.&nbsp; Whatever predilection I was endowed with 
			that provides me with reactionary statements such as &quot;I'm so busy&quot; 
			must be stopped, at all costs!&nbsp; I'm tired of feeling busy.&nbsp; 
			In fact, it's about time I figured out that I'm not busy, 
			really...not at all.&nbsp; 24 hours in a day is a lot of time to 
			enjoy.</p>
			<p>Oh sure, I can be genuinely busy at times.&nbsp; But it seems 
			that we humans feel like an absolute waste when we aren't actively 
			engaged and able to respond as such.&nbsp; Trouble is, some of the 
			activities we occupy ourselves with is pure garbage that is best 
			left alone.&nbsp; Time could be better spent with family and 
			friends.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>It's wonderfully healing doing nothing every once in a while.&nbsp; 
			Perhaps if we spend a little more time unwinding and meditating, we 
			can find ourselves in a better position to tackle the demons that 
			appear throughout the week.&nbsp; Maybe that's the reason why I do 
			this blog...I don't feel obliged to do it, I just write because I 
			love to do it.&nbsp; It lets me reflect a bit more on the 
			environment around me and the way that I am connected to it.&nbsp; 
			Believe me, the employment that I choose does not, in the grand 
			scheme of things, make a bit of difference.&nbsp; So then why do I 
			spend so much of my time at home preoccupied with the generalities 
			of the function?&nbsp; Rather, my time could be better spent.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>The people I talk to at work, the relationships I forge, the 
			words I speak and listen to...those matter a great deal to both me 
			and others.&nbsp; And I don't think I give those special moments 
			enough consideration in my life.&nbsp; My job itself matters only as 
			it is a vehicle for me to provide service to others.</p>
			<p>We spend too much time working as it is.&nbsp; Do I really want a 
			job where I work 65 hours/week?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I assert that it 
			must not be that way now, nor must it ever become that way.&nbsp; 
			They say that no success in the professional life can compensate for 
			failure at the home front.&nbsp; I think that can be applied to 
			other areas of life, as well.&nbsp; Work is what sustains us, gives 
			us our daily bread and provisions for our family.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
			not meant to be a replacement for or a threat to the main functions 
			of our life, which are family, love, friendship, meditation, and 
			education.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I'm not sure where I'm going with this.&nbsp; I certainly didn't 
			intend to end up there when I began, that's for sure.&nbsp; But I'll 
			leave it as is.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>Last weekend went off pretty well, </b>with the wife 
			celebrating her 23rd birthday on Friday.&nbsp; Late Thursday night, 
			I inflated 75 balloons while watching The Simpsons.&nbsp; To my 
			amazement, I didn't really become lightheaded.&nbsp; But by the end 
			of the third bag of balloons, I felt that my lips were burning 
			fiercely, and it was then I remembered my allergy to latex.&nbsp; 
			Hmm.&nbsp; Latex balloons might not mix well with me, then.&nbsp; At 
			least not 75 of them.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>So I had a bit of a reaction.&nbsp; I envisioned my poor wife 
			waking up next to Lips Manliss on the morning of her birthday, with 
			all me being able to say was a muffled &quot;Mabby Burbfday&quot;.&nbsp; Or 
			something to that extent.&nbsp; But the swelling went down and by 
			Friday morning, I was back to my normal self again.&nbsp; I cooked 
			up my special breakfast of Sourdough French Toast w/ turkey sausage, 
			but was completely disappointed in myself that I forgot to get the 
			OJ. </p>
			<p>After work that day, we went to a birthday favorite, Claim 
			Jumper.&nbsp; I swear those folks could cook a tennis shoe in motor 
			oil and not only make it taste great, but present it to you in such 
			a way as to make you believe it to be top sirloin.&nbsp; I had the 
			pepperoni pizza, the wife had the spinach salad.&nbsp; We both 
			shared a pretzel at the beginning, and the complimentary and 
			obligatory massive slice of ice cream at the end.&nbsp; Dinner done 
			right, I tell you.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Saturday brought an influx of friends to the casa, arriving one 
			after the other to enjoy a night of Wii Sports, Excite Truck, DiRT, 
			and Mario Kart.&nbsp; When we all get together, the best thing seems 
			to be the Wii Bowling, though playing that game mirrors the real 
			thing all too well.&nbsp; I play superb at the beginning, and end 
			the night on a terrible note.&nbsp; I'd say practice makes perfect, 
			but I have better things to do.</p>
			<p>So there you have it, life as I know it up to this point.&nbsp; 
			Who knows what tomorrow may bring.&nbsp; I do know that we are most 
			certainly leaving for Utah on the 28th.&nbsp; Weather.com says the 
			average high will be around 83 degrees.&nbsp; I say Arizona will be 
			hard to come home to.</p>
