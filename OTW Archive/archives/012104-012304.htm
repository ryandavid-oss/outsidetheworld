			<b>Successful recovery</b>.&nbsp; Ok, so I exaggerated yesterday.&nbsp; 
			The e-mail writing class did not do any serious damage to my 
			writing, as many of the rules have now been assimilated into my 
			collective verbosity.&nbsp; No more knife through ice.</p>
			<p>
			As I type this, my wife runs around behind me.&nbsp; There are boxes 
			upon boxes of stuff strewn about.&nbsp; Who knew that two people 
			could wreak such terror on a tiny one bedroom apartment.&nbsp; And I 
			wouldn't even call ourselves packrats, either.&nbsp; Quite the 
			contrary.&nbsp; I throw away as many unneeded effects as I can throw 
			a stick at.</p>
			<p>
			My cat seems to understand that there's something going on, too.&nbsp; 
			He's moping about the house with an extremely dejected look on his 
			face.&nbsp; Yes, human expression is valid on animals, as proved by 
			my feline.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I suppose that I should get off my duff and help the cause.&nbsp; It 
			frightens me how many boxes there are.&nbsp; So many 
			boxes....*shakes head* </p>
			<p>
			I'll see you on Saturday or Monday.&nbsp; I make no promises for 
			either.&nbsp; Have a great weekend!</p>

			<b>Did you know</b> that stucco can be removed solely by using hot 
			water and a scraper?&nbsp; I didn't know that.&nbsp; And while I'm 
			mentioning things that I don't know, let me add that I don't know 
			why anyone would stucco the entire inside of their house.&nbsp; That 
			just bamboozles my mind. </p>
			<p>
			Let me clarify by saying that no one that I know personally has 
			stuccoed their house.&nbsp; However, in a quest to help my dear 
			mother-in-law with removing a bit of stucco from her fireplace, I 
			ran across many stories on the Web of people attempting to remove 
			stucco from the entirety of their home.&nbsp; *shudder*</p>
			<p>
			<b>New Blog Link</b>.&nbsp; You may want to check it out.&nbsp; It 
			was introduced to me through my brother and fellow blogger, Adam.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The site itself is called <a href="http://lostcoyote.blogspot.com/">
			Lost Coyote</a>.&nbsp; Good stuff.</p>
			<p>
			<b>In other news</b>:&nbsp; Life just keeps rolling along, giving no 
			heed to the weary or forgetful.&nbsp; Like I said yesterday, it's 
			extremely hard to summarize entire missed days in one entry.&nbsp; I 
			find the pace of life marvelous.&nbsp; I sometimes have so many 
			goals that I miss the mark on a few.&nbsp; By and large, the goals 
			get accomplished or they get set aside, but never cast off.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Sometimes I have to remember where I've been by looking at my bank 
			statement.&nbsp; I'm so much more busy now that I have a wife and an 
			apartment and a car and a crazy cat.&nbsp; Bear with me as I have a 
			child.&nbsp; I might just feel so sorry for myself that I'll realize 
			how easy I had it.</p>
			<p>
			I'll quit yacking, back on track now.&nbsp; Above, you'll see my new 
			graphic.&nbsp; Whenever I open Photoshop, I end up creating 
			something new.&nbsp; I find a unique solace in graphic design, I 
			have since I first saw Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark.&nbsp; And 
			while the design and art that I create are not that amazing, it 
			calms my mind as I move binary colors around.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I feel the same way about most digital forms of art, I suppose.&nbsp; 
			Digital Photography brings me a type of instant result not found in 
			any other form of media.&nbsp; The creation of digital music grants 
			me the authority to be as ridiculous as I want.&nbsp; And digitally 
			editing video, once empowered only to those with money (and skill), 
			has been given to everyone.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>Google</b>.&nbsp; This is just super.&nbsp; Can I say that?&nbsp; 
			I regularly check my site statistics, just to see where I'm at and 
			catch a glimpse of where my visitors are coming from.&nbsp; In just 
			the past week, I've seen a marked rise in both search engine hits 
			and random visitors.&nbsp; That's good news.&nbsp; Why, you can 
			punch in the words &quot;Cucina Tagliani's&quot; and there I will be, right on 
			the top of the second page.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I just hope no one is disappointed when they look for restaurant 
			reviews and stumble upon the Blog.&nbsp; Although, with as many 
			words as I have on this site, one can search for many things and end 
			up here.&nbsp; Poor souls.</p>
			<p>
			For example:</p>
			<p>
			<font size="-1">neil diamond's wife<br>
			chris cross<br>
			don't drown your food<br>
			what is an imp</font></p>
			<p>
			<font size="-1">The above mentioned random phrases manage to bring 
			my site up.&nbsp; Whatever.</font></p>
			<p>
			<b>The Move</b>.&nbsp; As this is Thursday's entry, I must make a 
			valid disclaimer for Friday.&nbsp; I'll be moving during most of the 
			day time, and I don't know where my computer will be after the dust 
			has settled.&nbsp; So, an entry may be written, or it may not.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			See you later.</p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="../pics/divider.gif" width="477" height="5"></p>
			<p>
			<font color="#003366"><b>01/21/04</b></font></p>
			<p>
			<b>Moving.&nbsp; </b>Remember that impending move that I wrote about 
			two weeks ago?&nbsp; It now appears as if that day is just around 
			the corner.&nbsp; Are we ready?&nbsp; No, but we have an excess of 
			boxes strewn about the apartment.&nbsp; Do we have a truck?&nbsp; 
			Well, yes and no.&nbsp; Let's lean more toward the yes answer for 
			the time being.</p>
			<p>
			It's tough to summarize when you've been away for so long.&nbsp; At 
			first, I really believed that I would sit down and compose some 
			scrab for the Blog last Saturday, but that never quite came to 
			fruition.&nbsp; Regretfully, I didn't even bother to write when my 
			beautiful wife implored me to get back on the computer.&nbsp; For 
			that, I apologize.</p>
			<p>
			<b>E-mail writing</b>.&nbsp; Earlier today, I took part one of a two 
			part e-mail writing class for work, so I have so many alternate and 
			conflicting rules in my head at this time.&nbsp; My writing feels 
			somewhat labored because of this.&nbsp; It feels like I'm trying to 
			carve a dull butter knife through ice.&nbsp; I know it'll work, but 
			it slips a lot.</p>
			<p>
			I can hardly wait to see what two days of this class will do to my 
			writings.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>Flock of Seagulls</b>.&nbsp; Why, what a strange looking header 
			for a paragraph?!&nbsp; For those of you who don't watch VH1, they 
			have recently been touting a new show called &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;.&nbsp; 
			I never intended to sit down and watch it, really.&nbsp; But I came 
			home an hour early from work today and hadn't much else to do.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			To boil it down to the basics, the host of the show runs all around 
			central England, looking for the disbanded members of A Flock of 
			Seagulls.&nbsp; The four band mates haven't talked in 20 years, 
			there could be bad blood, one hasn't played the guitar in eight 
			years, and so on.</p>
			<p>
			But it was fun to watch.&nbsp; I know only two of their songs, but I 
			could tell that they were having fun again.&nbsp; Whether that was 
			made up for the show or it was true reality, doesn't matter.&nbsp; I 
			got to hear them play &quot;I Ran&quot; again.</p>
			<p>
			Let's keep it brief.&nbsp; And I will be back later.&nbsp; Anyone 
			want to help me move?</p>
