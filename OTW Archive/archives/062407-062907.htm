			<b>I thought it was pretty cool </b>that I went 385 miles on one 
			tank of gas yesterday.&nbsp; This feeling remained with me until 
			this very morning, when I started my car and backed out of the 
			driveway.&nbsp; I got no more than 15 feet away (at an incline, no 
			less), when the car sputtered to a dismal stop.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			It wasn't a very good start to the day, but that's the risk I took.&nbsp; 
			I can't imagine any logical reason why I did not stop for gas on the 
			way home from work; I had about 25 different options.&nbsp; But, I 
			was in a groove, man!&nbsp; This driver stops for nothing.&nbsp; 'Cept 
			a lack of gas.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>So I worked from home </b>today.&nbsp; Not a bad deal, since I do 
			the work from home thing every Friday.&nbsp; This does mean that I 
			will have to forego the process this week, as my WFH allotment is 
			finito.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I'll keep this entry brief, as I've been posted to the Moblah'g much 
			lately and will continue to do so throughout the week.&nbsp; But the 
			site redesign is going to plan, and soon you'll see a new and 
			improved photography page.&nbsp; First things's first, though...I 
			got to take more pictures.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/so-hot.html">In 110 
			degree weather</a>.&nbsp; Not the most fun thing to do.</p>
			<p>
			Perhaps the thing to do would be to take a vacation?&nbsp;
			<a href="http://www.snowbird.com/">I can't quite think of where I 
			want to go, though. </a>&nbsp;Oh, wait. Nevermind.</p>
			<p>
			That's it for now!&nbsp; Please head on over to the Moblah'g, if you 
			haven't done so already.&nbsp; Lots of stuff to be found there.&nbsp; 
			And please comment.&nbsp; Oh, and <a href="../contactus.htm">drop me a 
			note</a>.&nbsp; I always appreciate the thought!</p>

			<b>Monday evening, </b>and a wonderful dip in the pool.&nbsp; While 
			we were swimming around, Sumner asked me one of those questions only 
			children can ask.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			&quot;Why are the clouds orange, daddy?&quot;</p>
			<p>
			Funny how such a simple question can have such a complex answer to a 
			child.&nbsp; The sun reflects its light against the clouds in the 
			evening.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			&quot;But, the sun is yellow&quot;, he stated matter of factly.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I then tried explaining that just as he sees himself in the mirror, 
			the suns sees itself in the clouds.&nbsp; That brought a smile to 
			his face, and he resumed swimming.&nbsp; Coincidentally, Sumner is 
			an awesome swimmer, even better than he was last summer.&nbsp; In 
			previous years, he faced the pool and water with reckless abandon; 
			he feared nothing about the entire event.&nbsp; Seeing how he is 
			more fully self-aware, I feared this summer would bring trepidation 
			in full swing.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			But after two weeks of prescribed swimming lessons, the boy is 
			nearly swimming the width of the pool.&nbsp; Any pool in fact, just 
			as long as there is water enough to jump in.&nbsp; He lasts much 
			longer than his parents, too...he doesn't know when to quit yet.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>I'm pretty stoked to announce</b> a new addition to Outside the 
			World: <a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com">The Moblah'g</a>!&nbsp; 
			Go check it out, and come right back.&nbsp; Don't worry, I'll wait 
			right here.</p>
			<p>
			Back?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; So the proper term is &quot;MoBlog&quot; (as in mobile 
			blog), but I much prefer the Moblah'g.&nbsp; I know it's been done 
			thousands of times before by hundreds of thousands of people, but 
			it's fun and why not, eh?&nbsp; With this new blog, the site will be 
			granted daily updates.&nbsp; Everything comes straight from my smart 
			phone, right as it happens.&nbsp; It's my own little version of
			<a href="http://www.buzz.mn">buzz.mn</a>. </p>
			<p>
			I love the freedom that it gives me.&nbsp; No longer is my mind 
			tethered by my keyboard and mouse; I can post a picture and thoughts 
			from anywhere I wish now.&nbsp; Jeez, now that I think about it, 
			this could be dangerous.&nbsp; Well, with great power comes great 
			responsibility, as one arachnid's uncle once said.&nbsp; I'll do my 
			best to entertain.</p>
			<p>
			So, on the weekends, check the <a href="../http://outsidetheworld.com/blog">main blog</a> 
			site for updates.&nbsp; Any other day, head on over to
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/">the Moblah'g</a>.&nbsp; 
			I'll be much appreciative of the effort!&nbsp; </p>

			<b>As my brother pointed out,</b> it is quite sad that I only know a 
			song by &quot;The Who&quot; because I heard the reference on an episode of
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/simpsons.html">&quot;The 
			Simpsons&quot;</a>.&nbsp; Well, it is what it is, as Rocky once said.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			From the episode, &quot;A Tale of Two Springfields&quot;:</p>
			<dir>
				<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800000">
				<p>The various Who songs mentioned or played during this</p>
				<p>episode are: &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, 
				&quot;Squeeze Box&quot; -Mentioned by Homer in the hotel. </p>
				<p>&quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; was played later, as the group 
				&quot;broke&quot; the wall.</p>
				<p>&quot;The Seeker&quot; - Played at the start of the concert.</p>
				<p>&quot;Magic Bus&quot;, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; - Requested by Homer.</p>
			</dir>
			</font>
			<p>
			It was &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>So, enjoy the new entries, </b>and by all means, comment as you 
			wish!&nbsp; The only way I know that people are visiting this humble 
			little blog is because of the commentary.&nbsp; Plug away!&nbsp; I 
			leave you with the moon.</p>

			<b>As a matter of fact, </b>yes, I was putting the Web site off for 
			quite a few days.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			I'm still coming to grips with the new design.&nbsp; I do not know 
			whether it holds any particular aesthetic value or not, and the 
			lengthier column makes me feel as if I haven't typed nearly as much 
			material.&nbsp; I am tempted to beat my hands against the keyboard 
			in a chaotic fashion to pound out meaningless drivel.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Overall, I feel the page to be quite boring; it holds nothing of 
			value to me, so it might be gone/changed soon.&nbsp; Below this 
			entry you'll notice a new linkable calendar that I whipped up (ie, 
			divided one table 30 times, whoopee!), but I quickly realized after 
			creating it that I only create entries once per week at the moment.&nbsp; 
			25 out of 30 links now become useless!&nbsp; That is, unless I write 
			everyday.&nbsp; I have a few ideas for that, too.</p>
			<p>
			<b>It's been a pretty </b>fine month of June so far, though the days 
			recently passed have brought much higher temperatures than in the 
			beginning of the month.&nbsp; Late in May, we bought the wife a new 
			bike complete with a secondary seat for the little one.&nbsp; We've 
			wanted to ride bikes again for years, but some other priority 
			seemingly stood in the way.&nbsp; But we finally did it, and it was 
			perfect weather in the evening times.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			We haven't ridden in about a week or so now.&nbsp; Reason?&nbsp; The 
			temps rose 20 degrees in the sundown hours.&nbsp; That's just enough 
			to make me think twice about the whole affair, at least until the 
			monsoons hit.</p>
			<p>
			But!&nbsp; It will be a riding night tonight.&nbsp; Armed with water 
			bottles and a stubborn constitution, we will enjoy our outdoors 
			time, by gosh.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Side note:</b> the boy just waddled up to me and asked me if he 
			could give me a hug.&nbsp; I love Sundays.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Just for fun, </b>how about a chopped up panoramic view of my 
			front yard!</p>

			<b>Well, now I'm</b> just doing the Web equivalent of bashing my 
			hands against the keys, so I'll stop for now.&nbsp; The nightly bike 
			ride may have just been postponed due to inclement bad child health; 
			my wife just asked if we could give Sumner Pepto-Bismol.&nbsp; 
			That's usually not a good sign of things to come.&nbsp; Have a great 
			day!&nbsp; </p>
