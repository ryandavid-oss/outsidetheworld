			have a full write up on today's E3 events!&nbsp; Much happiness

			<p><b>The <a href="../photography.htm">Photography</a> page </b>has 
			been updated.&nbsp; Skip on over when you have a moment!</p><hr>
			<p><font size="4" color="#2A6095"><b>@8:00pm</b></font></p>
			<p><b>Evening time, and I feel a cold </b>bearing down on me like a 
			deadline.&nbsp; I really dislike this feeling, as I'm sure most do, 
			because it only brings the assurance of further misery in the days 
			ahead.&nbsp; When the cold first hits, you feel run down, but not 
			terribly so.&nbsp; You can still eat normal food, at least.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The last time I had a cold, I told myself that next time I got 
			sick, I would take the opportunity to eat heartily before it really 
			set it.&nbsp; Why, then, can I only eat pizza flavored Goldfish 
			crackers?&nbsp; I had the inkling to eat something...but this is all 
			that came to mind.&nbsp; And they taste like Juicy Fruit gum, for 
			some reason.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I hate colds.</p>
			<p><b>On to better news, </b>I found out late last night that the 
			family has an opportunity to travel back to Lake Arrowhead next 
			weekend.&nbsp; Finally, an opportunity to MoBlog remotely in a place 
			where most haven't been before!&nbsp; For those not familiar with 
			that region of California, I posted a few pictures over at the
			<a href="../photography.htm">Photography</a> section of the site.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Those pictures are mainly placeholders for the time being.&nbsp; 
			After multiple trips, I have yet to produce any solid prints.&nbsp; 
			I'm hoping with a little bit of patience, I should return with 
			something better.&nbsp; And of course, there will be fuzzy cellphone 
			camera pictures posted at the Moblah'g daily.</p>
			<p>Come to think of it, all posts will be located at the
			<a href="../blogspot.htm">Moblah'g </a>during the trip, as I won't have 
			any access to anything else.&nbsp; I don't know why I'm typing this 
			now.&nbsp; There is still nearly 10 days until we leave.&nbsp; 
			Anticipation is sweet, is it not?&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>My mind is </b>blank now, so I'll tidy up this post and bid 
			goodnight to one and all.&nbsp; The family and I will hop in the Fit 
			and head on down to Blockbuster, I think...we're really enjoying the 
			unlimited movie pass deal they have going.&nbsp; During the past two 
			months we've watched more movies that most people have in their 
			whole life, I believe.&nbsp; We've definitely watched more than we 
			anticipated.&nbsp; I could never get the hang of returning movies on 
			time, anyway...they must have figured out that most people were like 
			that when they obliterated late fees.&nbsp; I'm truly grateful for 
			that one, for sure.</p>
			<p>Sumner always seems to think it's his turn to choose a movie 
			though.&nbsp; He'll probably keep that up until we've exhausted the 
			entire Family and Children's movie section at this store.&nbsp; That 
			could take a while; we do live in East Freakin' Mesa.&nbsp; 
			Countless numbers of children here make for a big selection of 
			cartoons.&nbsp; We'll see what he picks tonight.&nbsp; He's on a big 
			Garfield kick right now, which is OK with me.&nbsp; I coaxed him 
			toward that title last week, it being one of my favorite shows from 
			my childhood.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>And no, he doesn't seem tempted by the horrible CGI Garfield 
			movie voiced by Bill Murray.&nbsp; Wait.&nbsp; I've probably just 
			jinxed myself.&nbsp; What have I done!?&nbsp; Heaven help me if I 
			have to sit through that.</p>
			<p>Wish us luck.&nbsp; Oh, and I polished off the bag of pizza 
			Goldfish.&nbsp; Smooth.&nbsp; Happy E3!</p>

			<font size="4"><b>The Blog Goes <font color="#336633">Green</font></b></font></p>
			<p><b>It was a busy weekend.&nbsp; </b>As I mentioned in the daily 
			blog, I had no desire to get back on the computer after Friday 
			night, which is a rare thing for me.&nbsp; Usual weekends involve me 
			plastered to my desk for hours each night, pounding out words and 
			redesigning the site.</p>
			<p>So why the change of heart this weekend?&nbsp; In a fit of 
			redesign rage Friday night, I looked up at the top of this very page 
			often, frowning each time at the volume of white space.&nbsp; I 
			wanted something different!&nbsp; I wanted flash animation!&nbsp; I 
			had no idea how to do this!</p>
			<p>Off I went to Adobe.com, searching for tips and tricks to 
			implement a custom-drawn animation into my site.&nbsp; Fifteen 
			minutes later, I gave up and simply downloaded the entire 400 Mb 
			trial version of Flash CS3 Professional.&nbsp; I figured I could 
			learn it as I went along, kind of like I did with Photoshop.&nbsp; 
			While I did take a class to learn Photoshop, the only real thing I 
			paid attention to was how to make water effects with the &quot;ripple&quot; 
			tool.&nbsp; That hasn't come in too handy, except for entertaining 
			Sumner.&nbsp; And I should add that's losing it's luster quick too.</p>
			<p>Back to Flash.&nbsp; I installed the program (nearly 10 minutes, 
			a new record) and opened it up.&nbsp; Nothing looked familiar, so I 
			poked around the menu settings and decided to start from a template.&nbsp; 
			Templates have historically been a great place to start learning 
			programs risk-free, but the problem here was that every template was 
			for a banner ad.&nbsp; That wasn't really what I had in mind.</p>
			<p>I kept at it for another two hours or so and let me make no 
			pretense; I was extremely frustrated.&nbsp; I have no idea why I 
			expected to pick it up and learn it without some sort of effort, and 
			the program made me pay dearly.&nbsp; By the end of the night I was 
			fed up with everything computer related, and I shut the computer 
			off.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>Saturday morning brought a </b>welcomed phone call from the 
			in-laws; this can only mean one thing on a weekend.&nbsp; Breakfast!&nbsp; 
			We don't do it often, but when the occasion arises, the wife and I 
			always recommend <a href="http://www.crackerbarrel.com/">Cracker 
			Barrel</a> as our choice of restaurant.&nbsp; They never disappoint 
			with their selection of morning delicacies, but we could never 
			convince them to go.&nbsp; I suppose they had a valid reason, as the 
			nearest location was situated somewhere down the I-10 in Tempe, 
			nearly 20 miles from our location.&nbsp; As a side note, I would 
			whole-heartedly drive the distance if it meant being spared from 
			such tortuous devices as Denny's and *shudder* McDonalds.&nbsp; I 
			used to like their breakfast food, but then I grew taste buds and 
			moved on.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The fortuitous occasion arrived a few months ago that a Cracker 
			Barrel was built just five miles away from the in-law's house, 
			nestled right next to
			<a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CFPage?appID=94&CMID=&langId=-1&pageView=image&catalogId=10001&partNumber=&storeID=55&storeId=10151&deptId=000000000&categoryId=000000000&jumpToPage=1&currentPage=0&subdeptId=000000000">
			the largest outdoor outfitter</a> that I have ever seen.&nbsp; I 
			think they may have an indoor outdoor inside that building, if you 
			follow.&nbsp; Otherwise, I can't digest the idea that the entirety 
			is covered with merchandise.&nbsp; The edifice is simply too big.</p>
			<p>I don't remember where I was going with this.&nbsp; Oh yes, 
			Cracker Barrel.&nbsp; I had the most delicious selection on the 
			menu, Mama's French Toast Breakfast with turkey sausage (<b>sausage</b>! 
			shout out to Janey) and scrambled eggs.&nbsp; I highly recommend it.&nbsp; 
			The wife got her usual, a mountainous bowl of oatmeal and a muffin 
			the size of a bowling ball.&nbsp; She can hardly put a dent in the 
			muffin, but Sumner likes to eat the rest anyway.&nbsp; It all works 
			out when you have a three year old with a voracious appetite.&nbsp; 
			No kidding, that child can pack it in when he wants to.&nbsp; When 
			he doesn't want to, well...good luck.</p>
			<p><b>After breakfast, we parted </b>ways with the in-laws and 
			headed back toward our side of East freakin' Mesa, and I remembered 
			that we had surpassed our oil change reminder by 
			several...*ahem*...months.&nbsp; It was decided that it would 
			probably be a good idea to head over to the dealership.&nbsp; The 
			brakes were shot on both vehicles, and the wife's car made Bozo the 
			Clown noises whenever you turned it on.&nbsp; The past few times we 
			had taken the car to the local mechanic, they being the cheaper of 
			others in town and a place we had trusted on multiple occasions.&nbsp; 
			Yet the last time, I was left unimpressed by their brash service.&nbsp; 
			It was time to go Honda, baby.</p>
			<p>And that's where it happened.&nbsp; Presented by repair and 
			maintenance bills that stretched the length of 8.5x11, we thought 
			twice about our future relationship with not one, but both cars.&nbsp; 
			You might call it an impulse; heck, y<a href="../pics/IMG_0941.JPG"><img border="2" src="../pics/IMG_0941_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../IMG_0941.JPG" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>ou 
			could even call it a rash decision, but we made friends with two 
			particular cars on the lot that decided to follow us home that 
			night.</p>
			<p>After spending eight hours at the dealership.&nbsp; Eight. 
			Freaking. Hours.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>And yes, we like 'em.&nbsp; Nah, we love 'em.&nbsp; We got two 
			Honda Fits, their newest car that promise good gas mileage and low 
			emissions. (you wondered why the Blog went green?&nbsp; Now you 
			know)&nbsp; They drive swell.&nbsp; And hey, it's the wife's first 
			new car!</p>
			<p>Good news all around.&nbsp; We should save a small fortune on gas 
			during the next few years.&nbsp; That fact played no small role in 
			our decision to make the trade.&nbsp; They're good looking too for 
			such small cars.&nbsp; Pretty functional too, I was amazed at the 
			flexibility of the cabin.&nbsp; Plenty of room for kids in the back 
			seat, too.&nbsp; All for the price of one inexpensive SUV!&nbsp; And 
			we got two of them.</p>
			<p>Yeah, I'm a bit sad to see the Acura go.&nbsp; Sumner actually 
			asked later that night when we thought the old cars would get back 
			from the hospital (it was the only analogy that fit, really) and I 
			told him that they probably weren't.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The Acura was still a pretty good car, but the mileage jumped up 
			really quick and I had already had the air conditioner and 
			transmission worked on recently.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>I don't even want to know what'll happen to the wife's Bozo car.&nbsp; 
			I was worried every day that she drove that thing to work.&nbsp; 
			Darn thing shook so much she swore it'd blow and leave an 
			Olympic-sized crater in the freeway.&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad told me at 
			least a billion times to stop exaggerating, but I ain't kidding you.&nbsp; 
			One shaky car.</p>
			<p>The picture ain't great, but the red one is mine, the white one 
			is hers.&nbsp; Cut the picture in half and you'll have a whole car!&nbsp; 
			I wanted to roll them out of the garage, but that would have meant 
			opening up the door and possibly waking up the boy from his slumber. 
			I'll take a few pictures later on down the road.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>So that was Saturday, </b>and you should now be gathering a 
			pretty good idea of why no posts were made throughout the weekend.&nbsp; 
			We came home pooped that night and slept soundly as can be.&nbsp; 
			Sunday was spent in the company of family visiting from Utah, and 
			that was really nice.&nbsp; We were still pert tired from the 
			previous day's activities, so we needed a break.&nbsp; Oh yes, and 
			the wife fell into the pool.&nbsp; Actually, Sumner pushed her in.&nbsp; 
			It was quite humorous.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>My mother provided her with dry clothes from the bottom of 
			Where's Waldo's 1990's chest of drawers, so she looked extra nice on 
			the ride home.&nbsp; She asked if I thought people could see her 
			through the windows, and I said no.&nbsp; Though I kept wondering 
			why so many people were pointing and shouting, &quot;There he is!&nbsp; I 
			see him!&quot;</p>
			<p>Phew.&nbsp; I think that's a generous enough entry for the time 
			being.&nbsp; Time to hit the hay.&nbsp; See you over at the
			<a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/">Moblah'g! </a>&nbsp;You 
			know how to get there.&nbsp; </p>
