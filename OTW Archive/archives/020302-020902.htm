			<b>Tuesday, February 05, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			I never could get used to Tuesdays...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Tuesday must be the red-headed step child of the week. And, come to 
			think of it, February very well could be the same in relation to the 
			months of the year. Perhaps this is why i'm having a bit of 
			difficulty grasping a hold of this time of my life. I had to head 
			home from work early again today. Apparently none of the food which 
			i had partaken of in the past day wanted to stick around any longer. 
			So it proceeded to push and shove its blessed little way out the way 
			it came. Poor food. My tummy (gut? stomach?) must not have been a 
			very hospitable host today.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm in the process of finding a good host for my new 
			website...coming in the next couple of months. If any of you all 
			have any suggestions in regards to which host would do dandy for my 
			website, just let me know. I have a few really cool ideas for the 
			site, and i'd like to make it a little more interactive. I would 
			really like to steer clear of any ads and keep it as simple as 
			possible. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Someone must be home...the light's on.<br>

			<b>Sunday, February 03, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			So, it's been a while...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The past few days i have been sick. Now that i'm finally feeling a 
			bit better, i'll catch up on the past couple of days. Thursday i 
			didn't go to work, rather i stayed in bed all day and slept. Oh yes, 
			it was worth it. Friday, there was an ice cream social (a huh min a 
			who's a m'whatzit?) at the GCC institute building, so i mustered my 
			strength and went to be social. Once there, i was invited to go see 
			a movie with some of my friends at the local dollar theatre to see 
			the movie Joe Somebody. And i love it, because even though it now 
			costs $2.50, we still call it the &quot;dollar theatre&quot;. But in reality, 
			anything less than $8.00 after the hour of 5pm is a smokin' good 
			deal. I guess it was a pretty good movie too, it was just way too 
			long. It's one of those feel good type movies, right? But my rear 
			hurt so bad from sitting for so long that i had a complete 
			contradiction working for me. &quot;Oh, what a touching movie! Oh, my 
			butt hurts! &quot; And so on, and so forth.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Saturday was a good one. A group of my friends and I went ice 
			skating. Mind you, i was still sick, and going to an ice rink 
			probably wasn't the best place for me to be. But it was great. I 
			hadn't done that in a long, long time. We decided to have a little 
			race between four of us to see who could be the first to go around 
			the rink 5 times. Whoops, great big monster mistake. Everything 
			seems to be going fine, well, great, until one of those 
			birthday-party-group 10 year olds decides to dart out in front of 
			you, and then you smack into him at some insane speed , throw him to 
			the side and hope to keep yourself in the race. Poor kid, i hope i 
			didn't scare him. Hey, he'll be fine. Bruises (broken bones, cuts, 
			lawsuits) build character. Lots and lots o' character.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			So that's it. That leaves me with Sunday, and all i've done is go to 
			church and avoid the Super Bowl as much as possible. I used to get 
			excited around this time. Wait, but U2 is performing at half time, 
			hope springs eternal.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Postscript: I shaved my head. I feel like a new man.<br>
