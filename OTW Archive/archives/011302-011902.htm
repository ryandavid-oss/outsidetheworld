			<b>Saturday, January 19, 2002</b><br>
			<br>
			So, it wasn't so much a &quot;bagel date&quot;, per se, more of an early 
			morning freeze party...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			For all those whose curiosity was perked with the infamous &quot;bagel 
			date&quot; entries, you may wish to go here to see the pictures. There's 
			only three, no one was really excited about getting their picture 
			taken that early in the morning. I'd rather keep those friends of 
			mine than have them beat me silly from taking too many pictures. It 
			was extremely cold this morning, especially for Arizona. At one 
			point it availed me nothing to have arms, because those that i had 
			were lifeless as could be. It was really fun though, the people in 
			the pictures are Adam, Staci and Jenna. They are my friends from my 
			home ward here in Glendale. We hiked around Thunderbird mountain and 
			then feasted upon &quot;hot bagels&quot; and washed it all down with a strange 
			carbonated fruit drink. &quot;A single serving of fruit&quot;, the bottle 
			said. Too bad i got half of it on me from shaking it up. Alas, twas 
			only a half serving of fruit...You may also notice from the picture 
			of me that i don't know how to smile. That would be because my face 
			is frozen. Or maybe only half frozen? Everything came in half sizes 
			today, so why not!<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Hooray for replies, i got a good one from my friend Heather to 
			Thursday's post regarding the memorial for the WTC disaster. You can 
			find that post here, or you can go to my MSN site and search for it. 
			I encourage anybody to tell me what they think about what i've 
			written. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			What? What's that you say?<br>
			I write about silly nonsense?<br>
			Exactly.<br>
			Here's to nonsense, in all of its countless forms.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Keep the faith.<br>

			A special thanks to my friend Dan for letting me use his computer. 
			My other friend Eric came back from U of A to find his parents 
			computer completely dead, so i let him borrow mine for the weekend.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I drove another 150 miles today for work, I'm half expecting my car 
			to yell at me. Either that, or refuse to go anywhere anymore. 
			Arizona roads can be torture, and the traffic makes it no better. 
			Tomorrow: The fated bagel date. Too bad i forgot to call the person 
			i'm going with...i ended up calling her at about 10:00 pm this 
			evening. Yeah, that's me. I'm as smooth as silk when it comes to the 
			women. <br>

			Hope your weekend is memorable. <br>

			Happy one-week to Outside... <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			It's been a weeks worth of writings and i'm feeling pretty good 
			about the whole thing. Now, if i only knew how to archive these 
			things i could make it so you wouldn't have to wait for a week's 
			worth of writings to load. Oh well, i think it's just been one of 
			those days, where nothing really made a whole lot of sense to me 
			anyway. Even at work, whenever someone would ask me to do something, 
			i would just look at them like they had 3 arms or as if they had 
			just asked me to sprout wings and fly to the moon. I was supremely 
			glad when 5 o clock rolled around. Oh wait, never mind, i left at 
			4:00. Yep, it was that long of a day... <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Today when i was listening to the radio, the DJ said something that 
			caught my attention. Apparently, someone has decided to create a 
			statue memorial out of the now-famous picture of the three New York 
			Firefighters hoisting the American flag over the rubble of the World 
			Trade Center. I thought that was great. Then came this, that due to 
			political correctness, they were going to make the 3 firefighters 
			white, black and Hispanic. The men in that picture, however, are all 
			white. Now before you get your knickers in a bunch, listen to me. 
			I'm all for racial equality and not for pissin' people off, but 
			let's get one thing straight. You do not rape history for the sake 
			of being politically correct. Yes, i know black firefighters lost 
			their lives in that fire. And many Hispanics perished also. But you 
			know what? A lot of women died in that disaster too. Why not just 
			put a 4th person in the statue and oh, let's make that one a woman. 
			And hey, since we've already ruined the historical accuracy of that 
			poignant moment, let's add a fifth person and make him gay. Then we 
			won't piss anyone off. I honor and respect every single person that 
			died that day. Regardless, one day i will visit this statue and, at 
			the steps of this great tribute to the lost, i will shed the same 
			tears of sorrow. But it breaks my heart that we take this insatiable 
			desire to please people over the edge and shove aside fact for 
			crowd-pleasing fiction. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			*phew* I'm done now. See you on Friday. <br>

			The world truly is a small place.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I had one of those experiences today that made me say just that. 
			Today at institute, after nearly 4 years of no contact, I met the 
			sister of the man that was to be my brother in law. I, being the 
			loud nosey extrovert that i am, asked every person in my institute 
			class what their name was and when i heard the last name of my 
			sisters ex-fiancé (no, not dead. just in Utah, apparently), my jaw 
			dropped to the floor. Equally, the person who i just met also had 
			problems with their jaw when i told her my last name. There was a 
			lot of talk of &quot;how is she, how is he&quot; nonsense afterwards, which 
			i'm sure no one here really needs to know about. It was a nutty 
			experience all the same. I'm just glad she married Kevin* rather 
			than the other guy.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I committed myself to play basketball at 5:30am on Friday. 5:30. 
			What was i thinking? Did i actually believe that i would be coherent 
			at that hour? Let alone be able to move well enough to play. Ho boy, 
			methinks i'm in for one long morning. What will probably happen is 
			the alarm will go off and i will rationalize to myself all of my 
			reasons for not getting up until it's too late to go. That's usually 
			the way mornings work for me anyway.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I have a &quot;bagel date&quot; on Saturday morning. Just what is a bagel date 
			you ask? Stay tuned and you'll find out...<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			*Paxman, Kevin. See relatives, marriage or People that i would like 
			to beat in a vicious game of basketball<br>

			Adventures at the local Fry's Food and Drug store....<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Today i had my first solo experience with the &quot;automatic checker 
			machine thingies&quot;** at such stores as K-Mart and the like. I was 
			sent on an errand to purchase Pepto-Bismol for someone at work 
			because, well, because he needed it. I am proud to say that thanks 
			to that fine automated machine i was able to buy the pink ooze in 
			less than 20 seconds. And to my amazement, i found myself giddy 
			afterwards, saying such phrases as, &quot;that was cool&quot; to the local 
			Fry's supervisor. What a nut case.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I received an email from my friend Mindy today. She said that one of 
			the phrases that i said in a previous blog was straight out of 
			british play entitled &quot;Rosencrantz and Guilderstern are Dead.&quot; Never 
			read it before, but it is now one of my goals to do so. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The door is always open. <br>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Yep, this is what i do when i have nothing really fun to write. It's 
			probably because i'm feeling just a bit too lethargic today about, 
			oh, everything. I figure this picture will whet your appetite for 
			things to come. <br>
			<br>

			I guess I'm in one of those moods again today. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I watch blessed little television as of late (due to the 
			proliferation of the internet or the lack of quality programming, i 
			know not which). So i was extremely put-off when i switched on the 
			tube today to find out that the Simpsons was 7/8 of the way done. A 
			little consistency is all i ask, just a little blasted consistency. 
			Why start it at 6:30? It always begins at 7:00. So i was forced to 
			channel surf, and i thought that i had found a suitable substitute 
			for my evening with Larry Kings' interview of the stars of The Lord 
			of the Rings...but when Sir Ian Mckellan described the joy he found 
			in coming out of the closet and how it made the world a better 
			place, for the world or for him i don't really know....i got 
			severely disinterested and had to switch it off. Oh, well, lets move 
			on.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			What's on tap for the coming week? Promised pictures, for one. Maybe 
			even a biography of one of my friends...<br>
			God bless.<br>
