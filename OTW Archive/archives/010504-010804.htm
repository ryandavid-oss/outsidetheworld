			<b>Ah, the power of the written word...</b></p>
			<p>
			In light of the recent inconveniences with my apartment, I wrote a 
			complaint letter to my management.&nbsp; It was your standard issue 
			request: Make me happy or I'll become even more annoying.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			And I hated to do it because I get so many of those types of letters 
			all day long.&nbsp; But, seeing how I read them all day, who better 
			to write one?&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; They 
			responded by telling me that I could have my choice of apartments, 
			and they waived the transfer fee. (whoever made up that fee needs to 
			have a stern talking to)</p>
			<p>
			So we'll be moving in two weeks.&nbsp; Oh, the extra space will be 
			so nice.&nbsp; I feel like quoting Hugh Grant's line in &quot;Two Weeks 
			Notice&quot; every now and then</p>
			<p>
			&quot;It's really quite amazing how small this apartment really is.&nbsp; 
			Do you know I can walk from one side to the other in six seconds?&quot;</p>
			<p>
			And so on, and so forth.&nbsp; I know, that wasn't that funny.&nbsp; 
			It probably wasn't even worth a weak chuckle.&nbsp; But it's amusing 
			to me!</p>
			<p>
			<b>Got another CD from AOL today.&nbsp; </b>Although they aren't the 
			perpetual thorn in my side that most people make them out to be.&nbsp; 
			However, I find their newest assumption to be quite shocking.&nbsp; 
			The DVD sized package itself was addressed to &quot;Current Resident&quot;, 
			but the outside of the DVD box clearly stated, &quot;Come back for 2 
			months free!&quot;</p>
			<p>
			Apparently, AOL can now assume that they have a pretty good chance 
			of reaching someone that left them for the competition.&nbsp; Makes 
			you feel good, doesn't it?</p>
			<p>
			The irony of the matter is that I was just looking for a DVD case to 
			replace one that was damaged.&nbsp; Well, I got my wish.</p>

			Hopefully I wouldn't enlist the help of any Popcorn Air Poppers. 
			Confused?&nbsp; Better click on the link above.</p>

			Good day to everything.&nbsp; See you tomorrow. Warning.&nbsp; 
			Extended three day weekend approaches.&nbsp; I don't know if there 
			will be anything Friday, yet.</p>

			The seventh already?&nbsp; The year is already speeding by.&nbsp; 
			What happened to the holidays?</p>
			<p>
			Every year, I seem to have the same cooling-down period after New 
			Years.&nbsp; At times in sleepy stupors, I will wake up and 
			completely forget the day and whether Christmas and New Year already 
			happened.&nbsp; I suppose this is unique to me, and it's probably an 
			indication that I could use a little more excitement in my life.</p>
			<p>
			<b>News</b>:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3855168/">
			The Spirit landed</a>...and it gave us 12 Megapixel photos!&nbsp; 
			This was fun news for me to read this morning, and even more 
			enjoyable to view these pictures from another planet.&nbsp; Let me 
			repeat that.</p>
			<p>
			Pictures from another planet.</p>
			<p>
			It's hard to grasp, is it not?&nbsp; I've tried to visualize 
			it...our little Martian lander strolling about on the surface of a 
			planet 180 million miles away from where I stand.&nbsp; And somehow, 
			this little remote control car is beaming high-res full-color shots 
			of the red planet's surface to Earth.&nbsp; Come again?&nbsp; Next 
			thing you know, those NASA scientists will figure out how to bring 
			one home...</p>
			<p>
			If you have the time, take a look at the
			<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3855168/">slideshow presented 
			by MSNBC</a>.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			<b>In other news</b>:&nbsp; I have a full three day weekend coming 
			up, and therefore have planned a small adventure with my camera.&nbsp; 
			I hope to bring back more than a few worthy shots, having already 
			promised my elder brother as much.</p>
			<p>
			Wife went to the Doctor today, just a regular pregnancy check-up.&nbsp; 
			Everything looks ok, and next appointment, she gets to look forward 
			to the glucose test.&nbsp; I have here in front of me a strange 
			viscous looking orange liquid.&nbsp; Apparently, she must drink this 
			entire sweet beverage on the morning of her next visit.&nbsp; It 
			just looks awful, and I feel bad for her.&nbsp; I mean, isn't 
			pregnancy bad enough without making these poor girls drink a strange 
			orangey syrup?&nbsp; I told her to take it on the rocks.&nbsp; 
			(joking)</p>
			<p>
			If you've ever wanted an archive of all of the pictures that I've 
			placed on the Blog (and I'll bet you a pair of cheese straws you 
			haven't), you can find one <a href="../blogimage.htm">here</a>.</p>
			<p>
			What a pleasure the Blog has been.&nbsp; I appreciate those who keep 
			coming back.&nbsp; I'll see you again tomorrow, same place as 
			before.</p>

			I'm unusually tired, so I'll be brief tonight.&nbsp; In fact, just 
			visit the link below to read an article written by my elder brother.</p>

			Once you are there, read the entry from January 5th, beginning with 
			&quot;What is Perspective?&quot;</p>
			<p>
			After you've read its entirety, please read my reply below.&nbsp; 
			Have a nice day!</p>
			<p>
			<font color="#006600"><i>Please note that if this comment sounds 
			disjointed and vague, it must be because I'm at work...<br>
			<br>
			It's been said that one's opinion of life and the world around them 
			is judged largely upon their own point-of-view. Many people lead 
			their lives with simple and complex beliefs, drawing upon them 
			whenever necessary (or convenient)<br>
			<br>
			This convenience leads to a certain lifestyle, which they justify 
			with previous experiences. My observation is that at times, the 
			previous experiences are manufactured after the fact...they never 
			existed in the first place.<br>
			<br>
			Thus, the compass that this individual has chosen has become corrupt 
			at some point, and continually points the person in confusing 
			directions. However, since they feel confident that they have 
			carefully made their decision based upon previous experience, their 
			inhibitions are cast aside and they venture ever downward into a 
			confusing web of decision.<br>
			<br>
			Because of this, I find it seemingly appropriate to lean upon an 
			external compass provided by a supernal being, or God, if you would.
			<br>
			<br>
			The freedom is still given to make life's decisions. The individual 
			receives further light and knowledge, therefore bringing purer 
			confidence in each of life's decisions.<br>
			<br>
			However, being limited in our scope, we can never be certain that 
			our observations of the outcomes of these promptings are valid. To 
			some, what may seem as a poor experience with this celestial compass 
			may be the endnote: Never to be tried again. <br>
			<br>
			We must have faith and succumb our will to the provider of this 
			compass...we must concede that our best interest is always involved, 
			and that whatever happened...happened for a reason. This is simply 
			too difficult for some to grasp and put into play.<br>
			<br>
			Again, we arrive at where we started. Thanks for your observations, 
			Adam...you always make me think.</i></font></p>

			<p>I know I've said it before, but I'm at liberty to say it again:&nbsp; 
			Lazy Sundays are nice.</p>
			<p align="center">
			<img border="0" src="../pics/dobby.jpg" width="389" height="314"></p>
			<p>It may be silly to post cat pictures as much as I do, but there 
			simply the best representations of feelings of relaxation.&nbsp; Not 
			since my father has anyone been able to sleep so <i>professionally</i>.&nbsp; 
			And I mean that with the utmost respect, of course.</p>
			<p>I had to work on Saturday, so that blew most of the weekend 
			plans.&nbsp; I had one specific idea that could have surprised my 
			wife, but now, that'll have to wait until next weekend.&nbsp; </p>
			<p><b>New Pictures.&nbsp; </b>You may wish to visit the
			<a href="../photography.htm">Media</a> page of this site, for there you'll 
			find the best in photographic excellence.&nbsp; Ironic though, they 
			aren't mine.&nbsp; I receive a digital camera for Christmas, and 
			post-holiday, the only things I have to grant are my brother's 
			capturings.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, they're absolutely beautiful works, and I wanted my 
			brother to be able to post them online.&nbsp; He and his family of 
			eight live in Spring City, Utah, and I honestly believe that it's 
			one of the most serene places I've visited. (I haven't been very 
			far)&nbsp; It snowed several inches over the weekend in this little 
			town of 700.&nbsp; The entire vista is encompassed in brilliant 
			white spectacle.&nbsp; I had my brother take his digi-cam out into 
			the open and give me a look. </p>
			<p>I was just discussing with him how odd it was that he could have 
			children in this small town and the population actually increases 
			noticeably.&nbsp; I believe he described it as anachronistic, and 
			that it is.&nbsp; I have never experienced life as he does.&nbsp; In 
			many ways, I wish I could.&nbsp; There are more people in my 
			apartment complex than there are in his town.</p>
			<p>That's all that I have for today, but only because I'm 
			distracted.&nbsp; Come back tomorrow if you feel so inclined.</p>
