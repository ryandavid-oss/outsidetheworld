I have a funny love/hate relationship with California.  The scales most often tip toward love, regardless of where I land along the miles that stretch along the west coast.  But every so often, I arrive in LA proper, and the traffic alone is enough to turn me away.

But we braved the gridlock to arrive at the Hollywood Bowl late Saturday evening, where our auditory and visual senses were treated to an outstanding show by New Order and Pet Shop Boys.  10/10.
