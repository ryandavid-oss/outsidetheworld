I remember, years ago, sitting in dance recitals and competitions while watching SJ dance. Sideward glances and silly smiles were common in those days. But now, what I see is the most gracious, energetic and beautiful dancer on the stage. Her years of hard work are paying off in so many ways. Great job, SJ ❤️
