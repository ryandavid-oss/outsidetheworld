While rummaging about tonight, I came across this. I'm sorry, but how old am I?  I feel like Sumner wasn't born all that long ago; certainly not long enough ago to have been given a freaking 3.5" floppy disk for his ultrasound pictures?  What in the world am I supposed to do with this?  Does anyone still have a floppy drive?  I can only imagine the stellar quality files that are resident in this magnificent specimen.
