One year. Many of my friends and family know that we met online as the pandemic was entering full swing. But not many of you know that we considered ourselves “dating” before we ever met in person. That’s just how powerful the connection was. 

We both decided independently that we were done with the apps and we wanted to focus on whatever future we could conjure. And my gosh...what a year we’ve had already. Looking back through my photos brought back a lot of memories. I love you Emily!  I cherish each day with you, whether together or apart. 💙💜
