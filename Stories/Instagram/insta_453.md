A dream. That’s how it feels when my mind wanders back just a few weeks ago to when Emily and I were married. Surrounded by our seven children and close family, we had a perfect ceremony filled with peace, love, and hope for a bright future. 

Life didn’t stop for newlyweds, and we hit the ground running near-immediately after the ceremony, but that’s something that makes this love so beautiful. We have so many people to love and take care of. It’s wonderful and exhausting and we don’t shrink from it. 

I love that we have this special ceremony to think back on as we progress through the ups and downs of blending our families together for their benefit and progression.
