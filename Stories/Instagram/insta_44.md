I've been without a grandpa since 2004. So I'm grateful every day for my wife's grandfather, who lives just a few miles away from us. He makes my kids smile each time they see him. He is a man of service and he doesn't mince words. He loves his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren entirely and completely.  He plays a mean Marble Game. Literally. He is mean when he plays the Marble Game. But it's only a fraction of the fire that burns within him...the fire that set his life in motion and made him the role model he is to his entire family.
