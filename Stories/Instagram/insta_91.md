With songs such as Jackdaw, Gossamer Thread, Now and Always, and Please Forgive Me, I regret that more people don't know about David Gray.  Then again, he doesn't get much radio play here in Phoenix, which definitely hurts his chances of acceptance.  The last opportunity I had to see him perform live in his signature three-piece suit was in September of 2010, when this picture was taken.  It was a raucous show, full of energy and emotion, with hardly a pause or a chance to surface for air.  Many of you may be surprised to learn that he is my favorite artist; after all, hadn't I named my son after Sting?  Indeed.   But also keep in mind that I named my last daughter after Mr. Gray.  Anyone looking to dive into his music would be pleased with any of his works, although I recommend "Draw the Line" or "White Ladder" to start out.
