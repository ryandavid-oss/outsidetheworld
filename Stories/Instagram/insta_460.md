I can’t believe it’s almost been a year since we met. The time flew, but lingered. We did so much, but failed to get other things done. Everyday, you make me feel more complete, yet I long for the day when our lives belong together in each moment. 

You make me feel immeasurable joy as we share more and more of our lives together. You kindle a sensation of hope in my tired heart as I watch you accept others as they are; as you empower those around you to reach higher. Thank you for seeing all of me, every good moment, every struggle, everything...and for loving me all the more. I hope you feel every ounce of love I send right back to you.
