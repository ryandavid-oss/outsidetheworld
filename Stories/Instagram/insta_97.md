For the entire month of December, I will be stealing Oprah's "Favorite Things" idea. Did I ever watch Oprah?  Nah. But I loved the idea of getting to know someone better by learning about their treasures, vices, needs, and brand choices.     So, this is a chance to get to know me.  Enjoy RD's Favorite Things.
