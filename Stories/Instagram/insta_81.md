Jenna tells me that I associate special memories with places, rather than with people.  It was an observation that I had never made myself; but it's true.  Enter Snowbird, a ski resort that holds not just a few memories of mine.  When I was little, it was a place I went to with my entire family.  Grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, even some friends if I was lucky.  When I was in my early twenties, I worked there as a public safety officer (can you imagine?), and now that I have a family of my own, it's our own special  place to visit whenever we're in Utah.

### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: #rdsfavoritethings #snowbird  
**likelyinfinite**: @svensix Agreed!  And that weirdly reminds me of a dream you had when you were like 14 or 15, that you had David Robinson's body, and yet still couldn't dunk.
