### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: Thanks @phxrunnergirl Really not sure how you and @jenna_gail can keep up a min/mile faster pace for 26 miles. 🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️  
**likelyinfinite**: @erwstout @klpalmer2 @cristinacotton @utes20 @kayceetorres_ Thanks all!  
**likelyinfinite**: @chelseyann87 I had to fight for that .01. Harder than I'd like to admit. 😝
