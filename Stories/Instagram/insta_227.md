Back in December, I tried to spend the month rattling off 31 of my "favorite things" on Instagram. I only got to 17 before losing steam. This made @jenna_gail quite upset because I made sure to mention Sumner, SaraJane, and Jenna as some of my favorite things, but completely failed to mention Sadie. This was never because she wasn't one of my favorites...rather, I'm just a lazy, lazy person. So, on her first birthday, I say with finality; Sadie is one of my favorite things in this whole, wide world. Happy birthday, Sadie-Bug.
