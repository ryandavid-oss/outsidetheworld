These next few weeks in Arizona are always bittersweet to me. Spring at its core is a sublime experience, but the portent of change it prefaces for our clime always leaves an asterisk on my state of mind. So for now, the windows will stay down in my car, my evenings will be spent in the backyard, and I will savor the canvas as it's painted.
