Day 4 of #HipstaDay is #green. Not feeling the creativity flow, but here's a shot from a few days ago. Who knows how much longer we'll have to enjoy this lush winter rye grass here in AZ.  #Hipstamatic #Hornbecker #Blanko

### DIALOGUE
**blakekimball**: So true.  
**rdevet**: John S + Cano Cafenol is oftentimes magical.  
**gerardgarcia**: I was wondering when someone would use Libatique for the #green sky effect. Nicely done.
