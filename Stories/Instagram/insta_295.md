Meet Ender 3.0. Finally branched out of the Honda family. Very excited. Thanks @Jenna_gail!  When are we going for a drive?

### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: @hurleyguy I love it, man. It's so fun to drive. When we work together next, I'll take you for a spin. I didn't use passport, BTW. I still negotiated a great deal, though!  
**likelyinfinite**: @mrsbjh She's all mine. :) But, we would love to live closer to you. Please come to Gilbert!  
**likelyinfinite**: @karlyndarlin Ender's empathy for living creatures is what drives him for the rest of his life.  
**likelyinfinite**: @greggrosstheboss Dude. You totally do. I kept thinking that the entire time!  
**likelyinfinite**: @kamiperry It's a Jetta!  
**likelyinfinite**: @greggrosstheboss Yep! I enjoyed it. Twice.  
**wander_love87**: You live in Hawaii
