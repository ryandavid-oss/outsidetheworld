### DIALOGUE
**lizziethayn**: I sent you a link via text. I hope that's still your number!  
**lizziethayn**: You will need to uninstall and reinstall iTunes. Shouldn't be much more than that. When iTunes is installed, the mobile device driver is installed too. Sometimes that gets gummed up.  
**bettijo**: I'm at a Dr's office in Gilbert, and what do I see on the wall? A magazine with you on the cover.
