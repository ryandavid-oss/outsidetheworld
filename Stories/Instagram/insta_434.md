Whenever I see a birch tree, it reminds me of Utah. My grandparents had a patch of them by their old house in Bountiful and I remember how fascinated I was by their paper thin bark. And there may be few things in nature more beautiful than a birch in repose, surrounded by a few feet of snow. That's the stuff.
