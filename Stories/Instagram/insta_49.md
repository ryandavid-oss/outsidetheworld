Many of Hipstamatic's lens/film paks are inspired by professional photographers. The "Foodie SnapPak" was designed with David Loftus in mind. A quick online search for his images will give you result after result of delectable dishes, immaculately prepared and positioned for the lens of his camera. Me?  I've never shot food before. Nor do I have a knack at preparing it.  But today's #HipstaDay project was to use this little Foodie Pak.  So my only thought was to shoot where all food begins; that wonderful star we call Sol. Too much of a stretch?  I shot this pic next to a Chipotle. Fair enough.  #Hipstamatic #Loftus #DC

### DIALOGUE
**janeykaspari**: This is all sorts of hilarious. @kkaspari, take note; dogs in shirts?  Nothing on this. ;)  
**originallarva**: This is "hang on your wall" worthy.
