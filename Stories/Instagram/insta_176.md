Back in June, I won a year's worth of donuts from Krispy Kreme. There was a catch, though; I had until 12/31 to redeem all 52 dozen, one per day. Not being the most convenient location, we made it there a grand total of 14 times. Our last visit was the morning of 12/31. I'm sure the kids will miss this treat, as I prolly won't pay $9.  Free was just too easy.
