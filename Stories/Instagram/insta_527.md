There are simple moments with children that make you step back and take a deep breath. If you are blessed with a gift of clarity in the following moments, you pray naively for time to slacken its pace. 
But it never happens. Instead, the years melt away, and these moments are too often absorbed as trivial notches in our parental tool belt. 
I'd say "just stay young", but it's simply a fool's prayer.  Instead, I ask that I remember to savor these moments while they're young, and keep them as warmly regarded as possible.

**likelyinfinite**: @blair_sammons just keep going to Disneyland with Ruby. You'll have so many memories and it's amazing to look back and watch them grow up there.
