I don't remember when I first read it, or who actually introduced me to it.  Over time, this book became a part of me.   I identify with almost every character at some point in the story.  I have lent out and given more copies of this book than I can remember.  In fact, I was surprised when I found an actual physical copy laying around my room.  Many people have a favorite book; what's yours?

### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: @svensix I'm a little worried about my memory...thanks for the shot in the arm!  
**lindskakosso**: Houses like those are why I'd like to live on the east coast.  
**janeykaspari**: And I love it.  
**likelyinfinite**: @captainrockit Oooh, now that was a close runner-up for me. Truthfully, I've probably read THGTTG more than Ender's Game, but EG still won out.  
**likelyinfinite**: #rdsfavoritethings #endersgame
