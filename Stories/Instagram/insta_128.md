On our last morning in San Francisco, Jenna and I sat on a park bench in Golden Gate park. Just sat there and felt the sun peek through the clouds, watching families ride past us on their various modes of transport. The weather was just right. Four days flew by, like they always do on vacation.  NY, Chicago, and SF are down for the count. Where to next, I wonder?
