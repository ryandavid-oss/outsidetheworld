Double sharing this tonight...I already posted it to Hipstaproject. Just a little friend I found in my front yard today.

### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: @kamiperry You're right!  I misspoke. I should have said when they're carrying their eggs. Not exactly 'pregnant'!  
**likelyinfinite**: @kamiperry I've never been harmed by one of these. They rarely attack anything larger than themselves, unless they're pregnant; then they will go for larger prey!  
**likelyinfinite**: @mrsgordon Thank you!  The iPhone is picky. It won't focus on smaller, skinnier objects like this. So I had to get close to him, move the lens' focus onto the palm of my hand (to give the lens something just as close that was easy to focus on) and then quickly move back up to the Mantis before it focused again. I'm sure you can also tap and hold to lock the AF and try that way.
