OK, this is a pretty weird one.  And it does show a bit of my quirky side; a side of me that exposes my obsessiveness.  Behold, the cup of Chips Ahoy! cookies.  I love these things.  Any more, I can't deal with regular Chips Ahoy! cookies, you know...the ones in the bags.  They don't taste the same.  No satisfaction.  Wacky.  But ever since my friend Cristina gave me something like 10 cups of these for my birthday, I've been hooked.  Major fan.
