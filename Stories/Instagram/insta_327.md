The boy and I camped it up this weekend, with my dad along too. Disregard the filthy car in the background...we had to travel along 12 miles of washboard road before we located the proper site. The boy was a great sport, even shunning all forms of electronics like I did. On the way home, he peered out the window and said, "dad, I kinda like not playing video games". He's a well-rounded dude
