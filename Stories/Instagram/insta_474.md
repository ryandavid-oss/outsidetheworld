I had to take this photo today because it represents a lot of changes over the past few months. I’m pretty lucky that circumstances have looked upon my little life with favor and blessings...I’m incredibly grateful to have kids that love me, family that cares about me, a job I look forward to every day, a better understanding of Jesus Christ, health, food, a roof, a car I don’t have to fill up with gas, and a funny little dog named Trillian. 
It’s because of *every* person’s influence in my life that I am able to live my life more fully and find my own measure of joy.
