I often think about when this girl and I "met" for the first time. I was due to report to my new store, but was instead home sick. Our first team meeting was therefore conducted via web camera, and Lindsey was positioned on the right side of the screen nearest the camera.  This perspective granted her a stature to be reckoned with.  My impression of her as a towering 6 foot tall girl was changed weeks later when I met her in person after her vacation.  No matter at all, because as I got to know her, it was clear that the fight inside her was barely contained inside her compact frame. 
She is humble, uniquely gifted and curiously charismatic.  She has serious powers of deduction, and can smell bulls*** from a mile away.  Apple knows they have something special in her, and have trusted her yet again by leading her away from friends and family for a season so that she can impress her skills upon a new store.  As she has already been away in Tucson for over a year now, this means that my longing for her company is simply stretched by miles, rather than occasion.  However, she should know that I am proud of her beyond measure, and wish her all the best as she seeks to improve herself and those around her by virtue of those extraordinary talents she has been blessed with.  I will continue to miss her, and hope that those in her new store quickly realize how lucky they are.
