How about we make a deal; I'll keep the IG posts to three/day while we're in Chicago. The other end of the bargain is up to y'all, I suppose. Anyway, @jenna_gail and I are staying in the Gold Coast area of town, and this was the most recommended pizza joint around. It was delicious.  If anyone else has a suggestion for us while we're here, let me know.
