The Nest thermostat may just be the best financial investment we've made in the past two years.  I love seeing it save me money when no one is at my house. Now, if only it didn't allow the Googles to see inside my house... #joke #notajoke

### DIALOGUE
**likelyinfinite**: @fabsgirl It's more symbolic for us, I guess. We break out the Halloween decorations, buy pumpkin scented candles, and just forget it's still 100 degrees outside :)  
**skotterzworld**: Nice, Scott.  Awesome picture and a wonderful opportunity.
