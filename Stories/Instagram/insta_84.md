When the billowy monsoon clouds tumble over our Sonoran ranges, it's almost as if the sweltering months of summer are making a peace offering to the inhabitants of this land. This July, I had a different sentimentality pervade my thoughts, as I allowed my mind to drift downstream into the latter months of the year. A cool December rain trumps all others. Now that it's truly here, I can see it for the contradiction it is during this stubbornly fevered time of year. In contrast to a summer rain, the winter storm tarries, never wanting to be in a hurry or rush to expire. It is nature's dissension; a difference of opinion of the highest quality.
