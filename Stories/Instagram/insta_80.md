Larry Bird was a great basketball player. Not because he was just a gifted athlete, but because of how he saw the game. It was said that he would map out the court and know where to be for the rebound. He would always be four or five moves ahead of the rest of the players. What does this have to do with tonight's favorite thing?  Play Rummikub, and you're forced to stay ahead of the game. Your current turn is the resultant execution of at least two turns' planning, along with anticipating each player's moves as well. You can't help but feel a thrill of excitement as strategy takes shape into action. Try it. You'll like it.
