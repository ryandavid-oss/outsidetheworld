I woke up this morning, and my son was 16 years old.  For shame that humans are required to blink; it seems that the more I shut my eyes, the faster the world turns when it escapes my vision.  Nevertheless, I am so proud of this young man.  He has grown in so many ways over the past year.  This video is one of my favorite memories of him. It was something we tried to do as parents, an interview on his 2nd birthday.  Things he loved back then:  Curious George, McDonald’s Happy Meals, swimming, watching dad play Gamecube, and going to the park with his mama.  Happy 16th, Sumner!
