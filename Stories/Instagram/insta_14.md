No matter how hard I think, I can't come up with words to describe everything.  That is perhaps why I put this off yesterday.  Sumner may read this one day, and from this, he'll gauge the situation pretty clearly. 
He's a beautiful boy.  To me and the wife, he's the most beautiful baby in the world, of course.  But there is a genuine beauty about him that cannot be dimmed.  From the very beginning, he has been nothing but full of energy and his love for Mom and Dad is apparent.

Born on April 8th, 2004 at 4:46pm, Sumner James weighed in at 6 pounds, 6 ounces, and was 19.5 inches long.  After a a couple of good pushes from my wife,  the doctor and I were able to cut the cord that had placed itself firmly around his neck.  Soon after the cord was cut, my wife reached down and grabbed little Sumner, placed him gently on her tummy, and kissed his forehead before he was off to be cleaned by the attending nurses.

I was pretty concerned for the little guy, and followed the nurses into the next room.  All I could do was stare in amazement at him.  I knew he could hear me, and I wanted to take him in my arms and hold him. 
Even as I write this, I find it hard to fully describe the day, not because my memory fails me, but because I've never had to describe pure joy. 
And now, home with my wife and child, I can finally relax.  I can put aside all of the fears and worries that beset my mind for the past nine months.  Instead of the constant kick beneath my wife's tummy, there is now a breathing boy on my bed.  Instead of silence, there is laughter and crying.  Instead of waiting, there is patience.  In place of tossing and turning, there are midnight feedings. 
And instead of two, there are now three.  For little Sumner, Outside, his world is new...
