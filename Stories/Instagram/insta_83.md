I couldn't put pen to paper today, if you'll allow the expression.  Between the three kids and other events that transpired today, it was a bit difficult to find creative time today.  WheneverI sat down to write, I felt that my words were too self-indulgent.  The last thing I want from any of these posts is for them to come off as anything but sincere.  But today's post does make me a bit sad, only because I don't get to play much anymore.  Oh, I'd reckon I'll shoot around again after the knee is strong, but soon, gone are the days of even half-court efforts.  I remember fondly those days and nights playing with my friends...heck, I'll name them here.  To Sven, Neal, Eric, Jason, Jake, Ryan, Jordan, and the countless others, thanks for the games.
