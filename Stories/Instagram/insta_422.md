Another picture from last week’s trip to Durango.  Like clockwork, clouds formed in the sky each day in a ritualistic yet unique fashion.  Multi-faceted like diamonds and varied in elevation; some looked close enough to scrape with your outstretched finger, while others grazed the impuissant Colorado sun in their boundless celestial circuit.

### DIALOGUE
**janeykaspari**: And you guys look great.  
**janeykaspari**: Dang, that's such a great picture!  Someone with unique photographic talents must have captured this moment for you. Kudos to them.  
**karlyndarlin**: That's a great picture of you two. And the dog too, I suppose.
