Superb time with Colin Hay this evening. I even think @jenna_gail may have enjoyed herself. After-all, he talked about Zach Braff a bit...

### DIALOGUE
**jenna_gail**: I like that he looks happier in the picture with you than with me. #whodoesntloveaprettygirl?  
**karlyndarlin**: Maybe you got really small?  
**likelyinfinite**: Musical instrument museum! @danielshorts  
**erwstout**: Your side view mirror makes it look like you're in space.
