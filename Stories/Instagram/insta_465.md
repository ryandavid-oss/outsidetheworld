I want to thank each one of you for the many ways you show gratitude for your blessings. You have touched my heart and I pray that the Lord continues to bless you in all the quiet places of your hearts. 

To my friends who are not posting right now; to the partnerless, the indisposed, the ones with sick children, who ache for employment, whose soul yearns for the missing joy...I see you and pray for you. 

As a dear cousin posted last night, life is not merely transactional. There is no great vending machine in the sky wherein we place our good deeds to expect an equally measured blessing in return. Remember whose hands our lives are in; whose mercy is extended to all of us.  We are, all of us, blessed and burdened. #givethanks
