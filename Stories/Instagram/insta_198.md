#CarsLand is pretty amazing. The amount of detail that Disney engineered into this place is unprecedented. The best entrance, by far, is behind the eateries. There you really feel like you're walking into a small desert city. And this picture? Sumner and I were happy to see ol' Red, but it took a certain amount of coaxing to lure SaraJane near.
