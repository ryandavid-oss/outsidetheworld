### DIALOGUE
**asherstephens**: Why isn't Jenna in her footie jammies?  
**jenna_gail**: @asherstephens You know she WILL be wearing them now, right? ; )  
**erwstout**: It's pretty cute.  Eric says, "Autobots, roll out!" and his motorcycle comes spinning out of his Kia.  They are quite the pair now.  Can't sell.  
**jenna_gail**: I can't get enough of this.  Adorable!
