So, I don't want to be "that guy". I don't want to be the person who posts all of these wonderful pictures from my vacation while all of my friends are at work. No one wants to be that guy. But these kids, these sweet, innocent, young children of mine are having the time of their lives and I want to show their smiles. Sumner is being a good big brother and SaraJane is being a very excited, grateful little girl. This makes the past few months so worth it.
