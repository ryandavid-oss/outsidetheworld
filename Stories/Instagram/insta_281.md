SaraJane and I have been working this tooth together for the past few days, inching ever closer to the ultimate moment when I yanked it clean away tonight. When it finally happened, she started crying immediately. It bled quite a bit, but I think the real reason she cried was because she believed she automatically turned into a big kid. After I convinced her she was still 5, she calmed down and agreed to an impromptu photo session to commemorate the special occasion!
