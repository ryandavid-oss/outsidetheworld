My sophomore year of high school, I joined the cross country team.  It was my own way of getting into shape for basketball season, but I fell in love with the sport.  I get pretty jealous watching my marathoner wife run with her friends and sister.  See, I haven't been able to run much in the past eight years, only trying once or twice before giving into the whims of my left knee.  So, these shoes lay dormant.  And before this past Monday, I thought they would stay that way.  Following up with my doctor, he informed me that my meniscus looks fantastic, and as long as I come back to his office in three weeks with a strong leg and good movement, there's no reason why I can't start running again.  Best news I could have received after these many months of waiting.
