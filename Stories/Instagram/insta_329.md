Washed out, but I loved this picture of my little Sadie bug. The kids begged me to take them to the school carnival tonight.  Normally, that's a no-brainier, but I'm a single dad this weekend.  The idea of wrangling three kids in a group of thousands didn't exactly appeal to my sense of excitement. But we went, and all survived.
