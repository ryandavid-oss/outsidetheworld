Over the past few weeks, I noticed something.  Gradual at first, but finally coming to a head this morning as I lay awake in the early morning hours.  With anything in life, when one becomes a spectator instead of a participant, things start happening to the person, instead of the person making the impact. 
For years, I let Facebook wash over me.  Endless shared stories, birthdays, pictures, videos, and statuses.  So many smiles and happiness, but as I stopped curating my feed, it left room for that which can only ruin quiet pleasant moments.  Hateful comments.  Hyperbolic headlines meant only to waste time.  Anti-religious sentiment.  Alone, in their own moments, they held no sway.  But in aggregate, they grew astonishingly pervasive. 
I’m not sure exactly when it happened; when it went from good to bad.  Maybe there was a gradient; a thousand shades of gray mixed in between that I never saw.  I only know the end result, which is the knowledge that Facebook doesn’t make me happy. 
A few days ago, I told my wife how much happier I was now that I wasn’t checking the weather forecast several times a day.  I found myself becoming grumpy at the thought of rising temperatures.  I hope that by removing Facebook from my routine, I will regain control over my perspective on life and remove some of the scar tissue it caused over time.
