Christmas of &#39;87; I was a pretty lucky boy.  I remember hoping and wishing for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  Christmas morning, I ran downstairs with the family and quickly surveyed the scene, trying to see if any of the boxes under the tree matched the size and shape of the NES.  Once opened, I was fixated on the next step; connecting it to our old downstairs television.  
I can still remember watching my father and my eldest brother as they fiddled around with the RF Adaptor, gingerly screwing the two delicate connectors to the antenna connection, fine tuning the VHF and UHF dials until, ultimately, I saw that signature screen.   
Super Mario Bros was the first game I played.  I&#39;ve been hooked on that signature platformer ever since.
