I don&#39;t remember when I first read it, or who actually introduced me to it.  Over time, this book became a part of me.   I identify with almost every character at some point in the story.  
I have lent out and given more copies of this book than I can remember.  In fact, I was surprised when I found an actual physical copy laying around my room.  
Many people have a favorite book; what&#39;s yours?
