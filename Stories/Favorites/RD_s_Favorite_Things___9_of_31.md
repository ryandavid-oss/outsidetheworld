Look. I&#39;ll eat pretty much any pizza, anywhere. Take n&#39; bake, carry out, microwave, dine-in; it&#39;s hard to screw up pizza. But I still have a favorite, and that comes from Grimaldi&#39;s.  
Tonight, we sat in close proximity to the prep area, and I gained an appreciation for why it tastes so amazing. Olive oil, fresh sliced mozzarella, basil, garlic, parmesan, and other ingredients were tossed about with precision. All of this on top a crust they prepare with PH balanced water that accurately mimics the h2o found in Brooklyn.  Delicious each time.
