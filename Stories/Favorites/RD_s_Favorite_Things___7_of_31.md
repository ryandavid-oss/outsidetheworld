With songs such as Jackdaw, Gossamer Thread, Now and Always, and Please Forgive Me, I regret that more people don&#39;t know about David Gray.  Then again, he doesn&#39;t get much radio play here in Phoenix, which definitely hurts his chances of acceptance.  
The last opportunity I had to see him perform live in his signature three-piece suit was in September of 2010, when this picture was taken.  It was a raucous show, full of energy and emotion, with hardly a pause or a chance to surface for air.  
Many of you may be surprised to learn that he is my favorite artist; after all, hadn&#39;t I named my son after Sting?  Indeed.   But also keep in mind that I named my last daughter after Mr. Gray.  
Anyone looking to dive into his music would be pleased with any of his works, although I recommend &quot;Draw the Line&quot; or &quot;White Ladder&quot; to start out.
