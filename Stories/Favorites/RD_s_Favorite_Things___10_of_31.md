OK, this is a pretty weird one.  And it does show a bit of my quirky side; a side of me that exposes my obsessiveness.  
Behold, the cup of Chips Ahoy! cookies.  I love these things.  Any more, I can&#39;t deal with regular Chips Ahoy! cookies, you know...the ones in the bags.  They don&#39;t taste the same.  No satisfaction.  Wacky.  
But ever since my friend Cristina gave me something like 10 cups of these for my birthday, I&#39;ve been hooked.  Major fan.
