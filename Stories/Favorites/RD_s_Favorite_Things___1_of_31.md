This is the stuff of legends; a true classic paired with the smooth taste of vanilla.  It&#39;s not an addiction in the sense of the word, but I certainly can&#39;t help myself when I see it in restaurants.  I also love that this tasty beverage pairs well even with the spiciest of Mexican foods, which is perfect, since it&#39;s found mostly in those locals.  
Otherwise, it&#39;s hard to find the true formula.  Officially discontinued in 2006, the Vanilla Coke found at your local supermarket is a second formula variety (released in 2007 under the moniker of Coca-Cola Vanilla) and while it does the trick in a pinch, to me it lacks the velvety nature of its fountain-variety brother.  
Care to try it?  Head to Rubio&#39;s.  With any luck, you&#39;ll be sipping this sweet potation in no time at all.
