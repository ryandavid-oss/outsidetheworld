Jenna and I had the sweet occasion to attend the wedding of a couple of friends of mine this evening.  Words heard during ceremonies always strike me; but tonight, one phrase in particular resonated a bit more. 
It was the concept that together, you can accomplish anything. I think about our eight years of marriage together, and know that&#39;s true.  So today, I present my ultimate favorite thing...my beautiful wife.
