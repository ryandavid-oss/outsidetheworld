The most poignant memories we make as human beings are commonly associated with the senses, with the most notable being our sense of smell.  I can think of no better occasion for memories to come back into focus than Christmas time.  
One holiday tradition I can clearly remember involves my dad making toffee for people.  Every time he made it, the entire house carried this its aroma. After making several batches, I was the designated delivery boy. We would wind our way through the neighborhoods, dashing up to the doors, ringing the bells, stashing the goodies, and running back to the car. My parents were never ones for attention with this sort of thing.  
The special recipe contains only four ingredients; butter, margarine, sugar, and chocolate to top it off. But as my dad taught me, it&#39;s the quantity and timing that count most.  
So, this is kind of a double favorite; the memories revolving around this candy, and, now that I&#39;ve grown, my love for making it for my friends and family.
