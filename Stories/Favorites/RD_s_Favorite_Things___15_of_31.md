Jenna tells me that I associate special memories with places, rather than with people.  It was an observation that I had never made myself; but it&#39;s true.  
Enter Snowbird, a ski resort that holds not just a few memories of mine.  When I was little, it was a place I went to with my entire family.  Grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, even some friends if I was lucky.  
When I was in my early twenties, I worked there as a public safety officer (can you imagine?), and now that I have a family of my own, it&#39;s our own special  place to visit whenever we&#39;re in Utah.
