# What's this, then?
## 2011-12-01

Greetings, travelers, and welcome to yet another blog by yours truly. If you've come here by way of The iPhone Photo Project, i hope you find this an entertaining diversion. 

Here, you'll find a list catalogue of my favorite things. One for each day, ending the 31st of December. Like I said on Instagram, I am stealing Oprah's "Favorite Things" idea. Did I ever watch Oprah?  Nah. But I loved the idea of getting to know someone better by learning about their treasures, vices, needs, and brand choices.  So, this is a chance to get to know me. 

Originally conceptualized as an Instagram-only adventure, I decided to post everything here as well.
