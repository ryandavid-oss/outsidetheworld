When Sumner got to be about a year old, I began to truly realize how blessed we were. We understood that the Lord knew Sumner would be the perfect child for us at that time, with me working longer hours at my job and Jenna looking forward to her 27 month long master&#39;s program. 
What we needed was a companion; along for the ride of the long road ahead. Sumner has always been that for us, so smart and understanding of the world around him. I don&#39;t know if we could have accomplished what we did in our first few years of marriage with any other child. 
Now, at almost eight years old, his little sisters know him mostly as &quot;Buddy&quot;, because that&#39;s what he is.
