I took this picture of her over a year ago and fell in love with it immediately, and I knew I had to use it for my post tonight.  
This little girl is an absolute joy; her smile leaves me in awe.   I thought I was prepared for how hard she would tug at my heart, but as she gets older, the gravity well she emanates whenever I am away from her is almost too much to bear.  But when we are reunited, her laughter fills my soul.  
She will always be my baby girl.   I love that she calls me her daddy.  Like I said yesterday, there isn&#39;t a thing I wouldn&#39;t do for her.
