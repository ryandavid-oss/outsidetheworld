So, about today's photo...It was quite a day, and I didn't have much time to pause and take a shot. So I have to dig into my reserve with this post.  With that said...They say that good artists copy, and great artists steal. It's not to say I think I'm either good/great, but I've definitely stolen this shot's conceptual background. Won't say who, but if he sees it, he'll know. Let's just say it's an homage.  **Lens:** John S**Film:** Kodot XGrizzled
