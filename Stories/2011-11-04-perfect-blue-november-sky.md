With the two oldest kids in school, stealing away for a long walk with the baby was easy. Finding something to shoot, well...that was a touch the opposite way. Having lived in the same place for five years, I tend to stick to the same path when I leave the house. I know the houses, the people, it's all very familiar and comfortable to me. That's why I smiled when I elevated my gaze for just a moment and saw these two palms reaching toward a perfect blue November sky. Hadn't noticed them before, yet there they were.
