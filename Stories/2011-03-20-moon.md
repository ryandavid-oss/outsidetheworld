As I drove home from work tonight, the moon was slowly rising in the east. I had a nice view of it all the way until I pulled into the driveway. I decided to pull out the DSLR and snap a few shots. Yes, this technically makes this iPhone photo a cheat; I only took a picture of the photo on my camera. Meh, I'm ok with that. As always, enjoy!Lens: Kaimal Mark IIFilm: Pistil
