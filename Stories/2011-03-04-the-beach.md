La Jolla, to be exact. The wife and I hadn't been here in nearly eight years, so the idea to divert from the original destination seemed well justified. After a quick FaceTime call to my brother, the wife and I shot the beach like it wasn't going to be there the next day. A few more shots will be posted in the coming moments.
