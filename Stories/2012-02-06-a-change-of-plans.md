While parking at church today, I noticed a trio of prematurely blossoming trees near the south side of the building.  Later on, I made it a point to pull away from our meeting for a moment to shoot it. Wandering closer, I saw not only that it was in full spring bloom, it had not yet lost its autumn color completely. I tried to take a picture that would illustrate the contrast between the two seasons clinging to this tree when I noticed another element. Dozens of bees were crowding the area, lazily hovering between branches. Normally, I would make haste and flee. But something about the casual nature of their flight endowed me with bravery. At least, until I perturbed them enough to provoke them. I did manage to snap this picture before I left. After consulting with my dad and the Net, I'm still unsure whether it's a wasp or not. These trees better hope a late season frost doesn't scatter these blossoms on the ground. Then again, we haven't even seen the low 40s since December. **Lens:** Helga Viking**Film:** Ina's 1935
