Tonight's storm rolled in line upon line, layer upon layer, until its full force was unleashed. More storms are expected tonight, continuing until tomorrow afternoon. 

I snapped this picture in between storms, risking water damage to my trusty, yet still two-years old, iPhone. A bit of editing with Snapseed produced the results you see here.
