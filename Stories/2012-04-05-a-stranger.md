A stranger sat next to me during lunch today. His attire was simple; a pair of faded 501's and a plaid shirt.  He appeared melancholy at first, but a quick glance in my direction contradicted my observation as he revealed a kind smile and thoughtful eyes behind wire-rim spectacles. Browned leather skin hung loosely from his aged frame, tanned from what appeared to be years of outside labor.  He ate no food, instead setting his day planner on the table and examining the contents therein. 



I considered him for a moment, and the thought crept into my mind that I ought to introduce myself and explain today's HipstaDay project. I grew hesitant as I noticed a hearing aide rising above his left ear. Fear overtook any bravado I had.  After all, I have never before approached a stranger to ask for a picture. What if he didn't hear me?  What if he misunderstood my intent? 



It was for naught, after all; he quickly gathered his belongings and strode away. I managed to snap this before he left.  Bummer, because I actually wanted to know his name and what his story was.
