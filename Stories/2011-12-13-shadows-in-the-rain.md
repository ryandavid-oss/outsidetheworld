I woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can

He claims I suffer from delusionBut I'm so confident I'm saneIt can't be an optical illusionSo how can you explainShadows in the rain

-Sting, Shadows in the Rain
