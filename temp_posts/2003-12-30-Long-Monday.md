# Long Monday
Date: December 30, 2003

Welcome back.  It was a long Monday.



First, I just couldn't pull myself out of bed.  Try as I could, the bed was much too warm and the air much too unfriendly.  In humility, I had to ask the wife for a ride to work because I just didn't have the enthusiasm to ride my scooter in the frigid air outside.



And I don't mean to complain, but who said that it could drop below 40 degrees?



Next, came work.  Drudgery in every facet of the meaning.  I watched the clock (that was my first mistake) as the time ticked by, minute by every minute.  And it was one of those days where every task you do has that same distinctive flavor of the worst scenario possible.



Hmm...that paragraph resounded of even more complaining.  Let's try again.



After work, I decided that it was the right time to take my wife out to dinner.  We visited one of our most favorite joints in town, a little Italian diner called Cucina Tagliani's.  I admit that it is quickly becoming my favorite Italian cuisine, surpassing even the famed and gloried Olive Garden.   I don't know, but I think Olive Garden tastes flat and pales in comparison.  The only saving grace of O.G. is their signature salad (dressing).



I get the same thing every time; the lunch-sized pasta bowl with marinara sauce and ground sausage.  The flavor is derived from the sausage.  And I should mention that their bread is way better than O.G.'s, too.  That does it: Cucina Tagliani's is my new fave.



So, if you're in Arizona, you ought to pay a visit.  It's never too busy, and the atmosphere there is slightly more authentic and 10x more friendly than your usual garden variety restaurant.



In other news:  I purchased a 512 megabyte flash card for my digital camera tonight.  I had to have it, it was too good of a deal to pass up.  I had taken some new pictures to post today, but I accidentally erased them.  I'm still learning how to use the thing, so bear with me.  Give me another week or so, and I'll be a pro.



And that's pretty much it for today.  I'm looking forward to some good shut-eye.  Have a splendid day.
