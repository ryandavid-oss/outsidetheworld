# Simple beauty
Date: December 17, 2003

I completely spaced this entry last night, so I'm entering this blog at about 6:30 in the morning.  The sun has not risen; even the peaks of the mountains do not yet show the burgundy hue of the dawn.



I sometimes forget the simple beauty of the still morning.  Sitting here in darkness almost persuades me to be something of a morning person. But I digress, as I completely doubt that this solitary experience could pull me out of a warm bed.



Wife and I accomplished the majority of the remainder of our Christmas shopping last night.  It's become much harder to shop for parents now that I no longer have daily contact with them.  The tried and true staple gifts of movies and music no longer apply, as I haven't any idea what they've been listening to or seeing lately.



So, I got them a...hmm.  Better not list that here, as my mother or father may have grown wise and learned my site lists such daily occurances.



Well, the day dawn approaches, and I've still much to do before work begins.  Tomorrow:  You can expect something utterly hilarious (if it turned out ok).  Have a great day!
