# The final bow of 2003
Date: December 31, 2003

So, this is it.  The final remnant of 2003.  The curtain falls on a great performance, the actors have taken their final bows.



If we could rewind the entirety, we would see many occurrences, some good, some bad.  To be brief, it was a wonderful year, definitely one that I would never go back and change.



And looking forward, we can anticipate a clean slate.  For some, it marks the beginning of a new life, a life where goals can be set anew and wounds can finally be repaired with care.  For others, it generates a new passion for living, and encompasses the supernal nature of birth.  Sadly still, it also represents a sense of despair, or a realization that life becomes unnaturally harder as time goes on.  To these people, a new year is nothing more than the turning of the pages in a book, a novel which, to their knowledge, only ends in one sour note.



I wish to confirm that for myself, it signifies a brand new day.  Other years have had their familiar nuances and flavors; in contrast, this year contains much that is unknown and starkly in direct opposite from others past.  For instance, I can now look forward to the challenges and immense pleasures of life with my wife, who can assist me and keep me going.



Later on down the road, I will be accompanied by another unnamed individual, who will provide me with even more love and lessons.  In other words, a family will now be my help, my power, my encouragement.  No longer will I be generating false hopes.



In other news: Wife and I visited the aforementioned restaurant again tonight.  I figure that our desire to dine out has something to do with the holiday season.  The levity and brightness of the season leads to a longing to be out amongst the crowds, listening and observing the general happy states of others.



It was, as usual, a brilliant meal.  We attempted to find another dish on the menu that sounded appetizing, but we gave up, realizing that it's always best to stick with what you know.   We've never been very adventuresome when it came to food.  Why, even tonight we tried to locate another restaurant to try out.  After much searching, we gave up, and I looked at her and mentioned that it would have been so much easier if we would have just heeded our first instinct!



No pictures, yet.  I really don't want to get into the rut of making empty promises, because that doesn't make for a happy visit.  As soon as I have the time, something blog-worthy will be posted for your viewing enjoyment.  It should be noted that I'll cook up some tunes, too...I just pray that I have the cleverness to concoct something that won't make you want to bang your temple against the broad side of your monitor.



And that's the end, 2003 is finito.  May you enter into the New Year in health and happiness.  (I can't resist it) I'll see you next year!
