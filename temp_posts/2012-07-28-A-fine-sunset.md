# A fine sunset
Date: July 28, 2012

A family wants to go out to dinner. A family drives to dinner. A family makes poor choices for restaurants on a Friday night. A family continues driving. Finally, food is found to satiate all appetites. A sunset greets the family as they leave. Such a reward. Lens: John SFilm: Ina's 1969
