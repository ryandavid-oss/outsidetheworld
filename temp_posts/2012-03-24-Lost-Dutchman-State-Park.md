I've wanted to come out here for a while now. Though still battling a cold, I felt encouraged to take the trip today after work.  

Got there with plenty of sunlight left. Even took the new bike for a spin around a few trails.

Also, an iPhoto Journal.  More shots can be found there.  Enjoy!

Lens: Libatique 73
