The iPhone Photo Project

With the right circumstances, photography that comes from our phones can be striking.  With this in mind, I started The iPhone Photo Project. 

Every picture you see here comes from an iPhone 4 or 4S.  The app of choice is Hipstamatic, a wonderful, inspiring invention that adds character and depth.
