# Glo-fish
Date: January 16, 2004

I just got off the telephone with Sprint.  It seems that they managed to foul up my billing once again.  It wasn't that big of a deal, because I was certain that they had made the mistake.  But it was a whole lot of money, and Sprint is the one company that I choose (I don't know why) to have automatically debited from my checking account.






So, the funds are gone until the next billing period.  (sound of toilet flushing)






.....






Sorry about that, I finally got fed up with the ominous odor emanating from my kitten's litter box.  I lost my train of though.  Wait, no, yes.  It's gone.






And he just p00ped again.  Thanks, fat cat.  Gosh.






In other news:  So I found out today that pet stores sell glowing fish now.  Now, allow me to elucidate.  I found out that they sell, as pets, genetically altered (modified?) fluorescent zebra fish.


These small goldfish look-alikes were originally developed to help scientists study pollution levels.  However, they are now being mass-marketed in the United States (sans California, which banned the sale of these creatures of science) as household pets. 






The news part of this is that two public interest groups have filed a lawsuit, alleging that these creations must be regulated by the feds.  They claim that these fish are unsafe and if released into the wild, could represent a hazard as other animals consume these fish.  We humans eat these other animals in turn.


So that's the basic of their argument.  Good case, I'd admit. 






All I know is that I want one.






Brother's blog:  If you haven't already, you ought to check out my brother's Web site.  There has been much controversy as of late with this particular article, entitled Voluntary Simplicity.  If you'd met my brother before, you would understand me when I say that he leads a very simple yet complex lifestyle.  






He is envied and misunderstood at the same time.  People turn to him for advice, yet dole out criticism in stride.  His comments on voluntary simplicity are genuine and intelligent, and darned if I agree.


However, I lead a different lifestyle, albeit I admit that it's still strangely complex.  Take for instance my story about Sprint that I mentioned earlier.  I could be without that stress in my life, but I'd imagine that I'd bored with that.






I think a fish hit on my wife.  No, really.  We went to The Rainforest Cafe last Saturday.  We were seated adjacent quite a large aquarium with various tropical fish.  However, there was one fish that couldn't quite keep his eyes off my beautiful bride.

He just sat there, staring








She thought it was creepy, I thought it was quite amusing.  And if you're wondering why I had a picture of this particular moment, stop wondering.  I take my camera everywhere now.  It's the greatest fuel that the Blog has ever had.  Ever.






I'm sure there was more, but that'll do for now.  To make up for this week's missed entries, I'll be back tomorrow for one more.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  Go get me a Glofish.
