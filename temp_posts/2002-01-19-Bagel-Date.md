# Bagel Date
Date: January 19, 2002

So, it wasn't so much a "bagel date", per se, more of an early morning freeze party...






For all those whose curiosity was perked with the infamous "bagel date" entries, you may wish to go here to see the pictures. There's only three, no one was really excited about getting their picture taken that early in the morning. I'd rather keep those friends of mine than have them beat me silly from taking too many pictures. It was extremely cold this morning, especially for Arizona. At one point it availed me nothing to have arms, because those that i had were lifeless as could be. It was really fun though, the people in the pictures are Adam, Staci and Jenna. They are my friends from my home ward here in Glendale. We hiked around Thunderbird mountain and then feasted upon "hot bagels" and washed it all down with a strange carbonated fruit drink. "A single serving of fruit", the bottle said. Too bad i got half of it on me from shaking it up. Alas, twas only a half serving of fruit...You may also notice from the picture of me that i don't know how to smile. That would be because my face is frozen. Or maybe only half frozen? Everything came in half sizes today, so why not!






Hooray for replies, i got a good one from my friend Heather to Thursday's post regarding the memorial for the WTC disaster. You can find that post here, or you can go to my MSN site and search for it. I encourage anybody to tell me what they think about what i've written. 






What? What's that you say?


I write about silly nonsense?


Exactly.


Here's to nonsense, in all of its countless forms.






Keep the faith.
