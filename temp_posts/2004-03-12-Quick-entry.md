# Quick entry
Date: March 12, 2004

Only a quick entry tonight.  It's been a long day - again - and I'm looking forward to hitting the sack.  The baby shower was a success, or so I heard.  I wasn't there, I skipped out quietly as the guests arrived.  The baby boy got quite a few neat things, he should be very happy once he arrives. 






My wife found it amazing how such a small thing could need so much stuff.  As I looked around at the treasure trove of items, I knew she was right.  From clothes to bathing supplies, this kid needs a lot of consumables.  Something tells me he'll be more than worth it all though.






We're heading to the Jazz-Suns game tomorrow night.  Here's hoping that it's a good game.  You all know who I want to win.
