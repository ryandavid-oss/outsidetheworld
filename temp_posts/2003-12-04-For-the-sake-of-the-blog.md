# For the sake of the blog
Date: December 04, 2003

It's beginning to be quite difficult to come up with enough literature to fill up an entire entry.  My job takes up most of the time, and not much happens there anyway.  And besides, whatever interesting information I have from that sphere of life can't really be written online, as I could somehow get fired for it.



Lately, my nights have been taken up, as well.  I'd love to sit down for an hour or two and really hammer out some thoughts on life at this moment.  I want to paint a vivid picture for any who read this on a diurnal basis.



But that simply cannot be.  I have too much going on, and not enough of it is important enough to mention, really.  I expect things to pick up, but that may leave me with less time to write and more time to enjoy what I'm doing.



Is that a curse?  Of course not.  It just means that whatever scribble you see here might just be nothing more than what you read tonight.



An entry for the sake of the blog!  Promise kept.  See you tomorrow!
