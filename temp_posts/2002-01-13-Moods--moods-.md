# Moods, moods.
Date: January 13, 2002

I guess I'm in one of those moods again today. 






I watch blessed little television as of late (due to the proliferation of the internet or the lack of quality programming, i know not which). So i was extremely put-off when i switched on the tube today to find out that the Simpsons was 7/8 of the way done. A little consistency is all i ask, just a little blasted consistency. Why start it at 6:30? It always begins at 7:00. So i was forced to channel surf, and i thought that i had found a suitable substitute for my evening with Larry Kings' interview of the stars of The Lord of the Rings...but when Sir Ian Mckellan described the joy he found in coming out of the closet and how it made the world a better place, for the world or for him i don't really know....i got severely disinterested and had to switch it off. Oh, well, lets move on.






What's on tap for the coming week? Promised pictures, for one. Maybe even a biography of one of my friends...






God bless.
