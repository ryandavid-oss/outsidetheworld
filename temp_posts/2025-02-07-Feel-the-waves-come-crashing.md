# Feel the waves come crashing
Date: February 07, 2025

The real ones will find me here.  If you're looking for me, you may have noticed that I announced something pretty surprising on Instagram about a week ago, only to turn around and remove everything this morning. I will not explain anything here at this blog...this precious repository of my most central thoughts and ideas for the past 26 years.  This is my safe space.  This will be my legacy.  This is where you will find me long after I am gone.  


I am so tired of having the rug pulled out from under me.  I am so tired of not feeling like myself.  I am so tired of anxiety and depression taking over my entire personality.  I want the pain to expire.  I want the world to shut up and start worrying about things that matter, rather than burn our mortality pestering people into fitting into ideologies that don't make sense.  I want all of humanity to love without fear, to lean on God in whatever manner that makes sense to them.  


So, I return to Outside The World to again print my soul upon these digital pages.  If no one reads this, that's fine.  Maybe even preferable.  I've poured myself into reservoirs that hold no water; it's time to quietly copy my soul, bit by bit, into something that matters. 


See you around.
