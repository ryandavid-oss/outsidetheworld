# 04/01/2009 - Before and after
Date: April 01, 2009

I really wanted to post something April Fools style today, but the uncanny number of Web sites and blogs pulling pranks was staggering enough to turn me off of it pretty quickly.  You never know what to believe on a day like this.  It's like one early poster said, "April Fools + The Internet = Crap".

So, instead of a hastily concocted lie about pregnancy or moving or some other nonsense, I thought I'd post a few pictures of the new yard for your enjoyment!

The entire project flowed smooth as silk; I can't really think of anything major that stopped the show.  It's nice to have a place to relax outside now, the kids seem to have a good time and Sumner likes having another place to go other than out in front.  We've already watched two movies outside.  We rented "Bolt" the other night.  It wasn't that bad, really.  The voice acting by Travolta (Bolt) was really well done, too.  It sounds like he had fun during the production.  I can't imagine many other "jobs" more entertaining than voice-over work.

So other than what you see in the pictures, we're still waiting on and budgeting for a new grill, a fire pit (or a chimney stove?  not sure now) and further plants and trees.  Speaking of the budget, we blew through money so fast with this endeavor that we haven't gone grocery shopping, even though we're way, way past due for a trip.  I mean, we're getting creative with our meals.  Today, I made rice.  I've never actually made rice for myself.

So the wife and I made a list of the things we'll need when we go this Friday, and the length is staggering.  Seeing as how the local grocers are throwing all sorts of sales, right now seems the perfect time to go.  Maybe it'll only cost us a billion and a half dollars, instead of a quadrillion.  We'll see.

In other news, you may have noticed my Facebook status the other day, when I mentioned that I am starting to volunteer at Banner Gateway hospital.  Seeing how I have a bit of free time now and again, and how I'd like to change career paths, the hospital seemed like a good choice.  It's local, maybe only a five minute drive from my house, and I've wanted to look into becoming a nurse.  Yes, I know. You can call me a "murse", if this all pans out.

So I went to get a TB test (looks good so far), and  I'll go back again in a week to get a second screening.  You know, just in case the first test is wrong.  The CDC recommends it.  How often is the first test wrong?  I guess enough times to warrant this double-test, neh?  After the background check comes back, I'll be cleared to go and working in the ICU.  The Volunteer Coordinator gave me the gist of the responsibilities, and it sounds awesome.  I think it'll give me a good idea whether I want to do nursing or not.

Time to go, for now.  I've reached 500 words, which is more than most wish to read during the time set aside for blog-hopping.  Thanks for the visit, and come back as you wish.
