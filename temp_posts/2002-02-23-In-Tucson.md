# In Tucson
Date: February 23, 2002

Live, from Tucson, it's saturday night!






I decided to head south this weekend and pay a few friends of mine a much delayed visit. I got into town at about 8:00pm, so it was completely dark and i didn't notice much about the surroundings. But when i woke up and went outside, i saw what makes this city so strange: The mountains. It seems as if they've been placed here out of a joke, strange scragly-pointly-blotchy creations that look so out of place, it couldn't look weirder even if there was lava spewing forth from the peaks. But other than that, it looks and feels a lot like the rest of Arizona, flat, hot, and brown. 






Not much else of substance to write yet today, i suppose that i could say that i might write more tonight, but from all prior experience, we all know that will not happen. I'll be too tired, lazy, or both to do anything. So be that as it may, you have today's entry. 






Peace and love to all.
