I'm unusually tired, so I'll be brief tonight.  In fact, just visit the link below to read an article written by my elder brother.

Once you are there, read the entry from January 5th, beginning with "What is Perspective?"


After you've read its entirety, please read my reply below.  Have a nice day!






Please note that if this comment sounds disjointed and vague, it must be because I'm at work...



It's been said that one's opinion of life and the world around them is judged largely upon their own point-of-view. Many people lead their lives with simple and complex beliefs, drawing upon them whenever necessary (or convenient)



This convenience leads to a certain lifestyle, which they justify with previous experiences. My observation is that at times, the previous experiences are manufactured after the fact...they never existed in the first place.



Thus, the compass that this individual has chosen has become corrupt at some point, and continually points the person in confusing directions. However, since they feel confident that they have carefully made their decision based upon previous experience, their inhibitions are cast aside and they venture ever downward into a confusing web of decision.



Because of this, I find it seemingly appropriate to lean upon an external compass provided by a supernal being, or God, if you would. 



The freedom is still given to make life's decisions. The individual receives further light and knowledge, therefore bringing purer confidence in each of life's decisions.



However, being limited in our scope, we can never be certain that our observations of the outcomes of these promptings are valid. To some, what may seem as a poor experience with this celestial compass may be the endnote: Never to be tried again. 



We must have faith and succumb our will to the provider of this compass...we must concede that our best interest is always involved, and that whatever happened...happened for a reason. This is simply too difficult for some to grasp and put into play.



Again, we arrive at where we started. Thanks for your observations, Adam...you always make me think.
