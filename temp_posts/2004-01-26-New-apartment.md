# New apartment
Date: January 26, 2004

The best news?  I have a window with a near perfect view of the sunset.  From the sky's velvet canopy, light cascades toward the horizon in a stunning gradient of blue and white.  The area just above the surrounding buildings is light gray, and the clouds have no texture.






It's not perfect, but I'm going to love living here.






The move went as I'd anticipated, with a few bumps along the way.  With the help of a few friends and family members, we were able to complete the transition in about seven hours.  I'm still recouping from the weekend.  Every portion of my body aches.






The new place is just big enough for us.  There is plenty of open carpet space to sprawl out on, and all of our furniture fits without cramping.  The most noticeable benefit is that the computer is no longer in the dining room.  What a boon, says I.






But the weekend went by too fast.  I hardly remember anything other than moving, and I want some more time to enjoy the apartment with my wife.  Poor thing, she hasn't even been home, really.  Right after the move, she went to work.  She hasn't slept in days, it seems.  But she's pretty tough, and she'll get to sleep in tomorrow for sure.






That's it.  The sun has set, thus placing its darkening influence over my mind.  Best to all, and may I add a thank you to all of the frequent visitors.  Send an e-mail, eh?
