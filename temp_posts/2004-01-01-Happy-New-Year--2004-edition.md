# Happy New Year, 2004 edition
Date: January 01, 2004

Happy New Year, all.  Welcome to 2004.






While I did not plan on writing anything today because of the holiday, I did create something rather blogworthy.  Credit needs to be extended to my friend Ryan.  He did suggest the musical theme to the video you are about to witness.






I call it Round 2.  You may call it whatever you wish.






I was going to embed this file in the Blog page, but I didn't want it to open automatically when the page was opened.   It's a 1.3 megabyte download; so, my apologies to those with slow dial-up connections.






You can find this video in the Media page.  Enjoy!
