For any worried that I might not have survived coming down off of that terrible sugar/caffeine/deer urine high, fear not.  I am back amongst the living after a brief rest and some good Italian food. We're now in American Fork at the local Shade store, which looks like it inhabited an old red brick elementary school.  The wife has been looking extra-forward to this event.  I'll just sit back in this ultra comfortable husband chair and type away while she tries on clothes.I'll try and post some pictures a little later of the surroundings and what-not.  Thanks for visiting!
