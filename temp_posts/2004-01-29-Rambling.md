# Rambling
Date: January 29, 2004

I was going to come back last night with a few more words about my adventure to the car dealership.  But now it's too late, and it's all out of my system. 






No, it's not.  If it really were, then I wouldn't be in front of my computer, beating the keys.  Actually, I'm simply rambling.  I figure that one of these thoughts in my mind might take hold or spark another emotion.  But writing with emotion might give too much away at this point.






Phooey.  I'm exhausted.  I'm writing tomorrow's entry right now.
