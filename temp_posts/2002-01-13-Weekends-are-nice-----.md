Weekends are nice.....



Especially now, having worked the whole week. I actually appreciated the extra little bit o' sleep that i got this morning. You may be asking yourself, "Why does he make it sound like a tough thing to work a week"? Well, it isn't, truly.



But you must understand, my last job was working as a "Public Safety Officer" at Snowbird ski resort. That basically consisted of staring at little camera monitors and oh, walking around. Walking around was the hard part, you see, because i was already half asleep from staring at the aforementioned little camera monitors by the time my relief showed. Yeah, it was a hard life.....



Enough of that. Let's see, something noteworthy about today...not much i guess. I did achieve my goal of purchasing the brown bag special at Sonic today...my friend Dan and i were a bit peckish at lunch time and i'll tell you, it was 6 dollars well spent. We didn't do a whole lot else today but Dan's girlfriend Katie came by and told us that she got a job as a massage therapist...kudos to you, Katie.



That's about it for now, i suppose.



Oh, happy anniversary, Jake and Nicole. 1 year today!
