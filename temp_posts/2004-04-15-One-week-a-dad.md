# One week a dad
Date: April 15, 2004

Oh no!  Taxes are due.  Wait, they're all done.  Good deal.






Nothing gets you in the mood quite like perusing the blogosphere.  I know of quite a few crazy blogs out there, some of which I have listed below in no particular order.  It's not a matter of, "If they can write, I can write."  It's simply the fact that I believe it's an honor to read a part of these people's lives, and the only way that I know to repay is to return blog-blather in kind. 






Sumner's birthday.  Ok, not really.  But he is one week old today, and it flew by.  If this is how the rest of his life is going to be, then I would be well-off if I paid as much attention as possible.  He's manages to move his little head around quite a bit.  When he hears my voice, he lifts his noggin off of his mother's chest and peeks around a little bit, then drops his head back down in exhaustion.  What a kid.  He'll be mobile before I know it.






I felt like a couch potato today.  After watching "Pimp My Ride" on MTV and playing every single level on Super Mario Brothers II, I think it's safe to say that I've had enough television for a while.  But I'm trying to get things in while the boy is asleep, that's all.  Oh, and my wife made the most delicious entree in the world again today.  Chicken and Sour Cream enchiladas. 






Wait.  Telephone's ringing.  In the baby's room.






Ok, I've returned, and the baby is fully awake now.  So as to allow my wife a little extra sleepy time, I've taken the little one and am attempting to finish off tonight's entry with him in tow.  It's no small feat to type with two hands while balancing a one-week old on your chest.  I can barely see the monitor.  This is also a fairly comical sight, as he is pecking gently at my shirt to see if he can get something to eat.  Sorry little one, nothing for you there.






Alright, I had more to write, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I'll have to cut this short.  Bigger things to attend to at the moment.  More later!
