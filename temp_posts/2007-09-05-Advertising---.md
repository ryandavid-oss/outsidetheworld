# Advertising...
Date: September 05, 2007

Usually, advertising on Web sites is targeted pretty well to me. But today, that changed in a flash. Just read this.  I was absolutely bewildered when I saw it.  The part that gets me is where is says, "Your sister's wedding has been fixed."  Do weddings break? 

Yeah, I get it. It's India.  But it's still an odd advertisement to find on a tech blog.
