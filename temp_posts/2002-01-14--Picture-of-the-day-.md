#  Picture of the day 
Date: January 14, 2002

Yep, this is what i do when i have nothing really fun to write. It's probably because i'm feeling just a bit too lethargic today about, oh, everything. I figure this picture will whet your appetite for things to come. 






Take care.






Postscript: I took this picture at the airport today, i just thought it looked neat for some reason.
