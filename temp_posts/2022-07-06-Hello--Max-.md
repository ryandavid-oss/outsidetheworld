They even have the same expression.
I know there will be things I miss about the Tesla.  Carrying around a key again is weird, and Auto Pilot was so nice to have.  But the new car is so quiet, smooth, and I have CarPlay back!  
I'll come back later and give more updates, as I have only driven her a couple of times.  But it sure is a welcome sigh of relief to have an EV again.
