# That place, that memory...
Date: February 10, 2025

I dance along the path
    lonely emerald fields on either side


I gaze into the distant canyon


    and know that I cannot enter




Every star seems to smile down this evening
    each one shines its own way
    and the world is quiet
        it does not know I am here




The crisp air haunts me
    its aroma seems too familiar
    yes, but under different circumstances
        this would be true




there seems to be an end
    as the mountain peak swallows up the sky
    my perspective is my weakness
        outside the world is new…
