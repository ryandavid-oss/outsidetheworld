Ok, since I didn't post on Thursday, I'll give you all a special treat.  It's more than a weekend edition of the Blog, oh yes.



It's my first song.



It may only be :57 seconds long, it may not be composed of the greatest sounds.  And it just may beat into your head like a bag of hammers.














But here it is.  Enjoy!
