    <title>05/13/09 - Star Trek, or something...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-84 alignleft" title="photo-77" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/photo-77-150x150.jpg" alt="photo-77" width="150" height="150" /&gt;Ooh, writer’s block. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; My mind has been empty this entire week.  I know the solution is always “start writing”, but I feel I have nothing to say.  A house full of sick kids and adults has left me worn out.  Myself?  I’m ok.  But usually, I’m a night owl.  Lately I can’t stay up much past 9:00.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;We saw Star Trek last Friday.  If it weren’t for that brief diversion, I’d be much grumpier right now.  I love a night at the cinema.  It helped tremendously that the movie was good, too.  I’d never been disappointed by the previous Trek movies, but I’d rarely been particularly impressed, either.  A few of them wowed me, First Contact being the one that pops into my mind first. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;It doesn’t matter.  I’m enamored with the idealistic future of Star Trek.  Not the technology, though that’s all well and good.  Who wouldn’t love the idea of forgoing the 13 hour drive to Utah for a little transporter action?  That’s a story for a different day, I think. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;No, the future I speak of is how those from Earth ended up as a human race.  An entire people brought together not entirely because of the threat of annihilation, but because of the cause of discovery and exploration.  Contact outside of the inky blackness of space caused us to wake from our apathetic and self-absorbed nature.  It’s cliche, but those in the Trek future found out that they were not alone, and that was the reason to reach for something better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;The wife was shocked, and still a little unbelieving, to hear my confession that Star Trek, not Star Wars, is my favorite set of Sci-Fi flicks.  I tried to explain why; Star Wars is fun and vast, but it holds no ties to mother Earth.  It’s very separate and  it allows for a great diversion, but it doesn’t make me think (and hope) like Trek does. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t learn heavily toward the majority of my religious culture. Being Mormon, we are taught to hope toward the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, which I truly believe in and look forward to.  I have a feeling, however; that some of my faith look to every current event as a sign of doom and destruction, and I’ve never found that a deeply satisfying outlook on life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some may argue that it is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;a sign of weak faith on my part, or a misplaced love of this world that makes me believe that the human race shouldn’t be on a one-way collision course with doom.  Call me crazy for wanting to believe that we should pull ourselves out of any tailspin that we find ourselves in.  Call me naive because I believe that a common cause, such as discovering the space beyond our own, could firmly and finally bring us together.  You can call me those things, only because I’m pulled both ways and have been taught that this cannot not be our final ordination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thought about a different way, I know that the final cleansing of Earth does not mark the end of human existence.  I know that, as immortal beings, we will continue to learn and grow and have the vast treasures of the universe unlocked and unfolded before our very eyes.  This brings me great joy to think about, more-so than the vain hope that alone we humans may finally figure out how to be civil to one another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do look up at the night sky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; every now and again, and I do see God working.  I know this is his creation, and I believe in the scientific nature and order of it.  I wish I had a telescope that could show me the heavens as they are now; it baffles my mind that the light I see in the sky predates my own existence my millions of years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have no idea how a story about a night out to the movies turned into a religious and philosophical meditative drama, but there we have it.  That’s why I like Star Trek more than Star Wars.  It makes me think.  I don’t like taking things for granted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And look at that. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; I started writing, and the words finally came.  They may not have made sense to you, but I had a great time putting them on the screen.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Power outage</title>
    <content type='html'>Sorry about yesterday...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was preparing to write last nights' entry, when all of a sudden, *poof* the power went out. &amp;nbsp;It was an incredibly eerie feeling; we've never seen it that dark at our apartment. &amp;nbsp;Even when all of our lights were out, we always had the lamps outside shining through our windows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the lights went dark, several hoots and hollers were heard from the adjacent apartment buildings. &amp;nbsp;I looked outside, alarmed. &amp;nbsp;"Oh, it's just the neighbor boys!", I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I now know that a power failure must be an invitation for young men to begin acting like loons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least 10 of them ended up jumping in the neighboring pool. &amp;nbsp;When they realized that, "Hey, it's just a power outage, and we're cold", they finally shut up and got out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the rest of the evening was spent in stillness and candlelight. &amp;nbsp;Wife and I played cards, well, we played "Go Fish" to be specific. &amp;nbsp;Go Fish is now Wife's favorite game to play with me. &amp;nbsp;Did I mention that she's never won? &amp;nbsp;But it's her favorite game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yeah. &amp;nbsp;Dobby completely wrecked our Christmas tree two nights ago. &amp;nbsp;He decided that it was his new play thing, so he climbed through and through.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was left was not pretty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, he's on my bad list at the moment. &amp;nbsp;And he knows it, too. &amp;nbsp;He sulks around the house, occasionally glancing up at me, begging to see a glimmer of recognition that he's a good kitty. &amp;nbsp; But every time, I give him the look that makes him understand that he's in the dog house. &amp;nbsp;Pardon my language.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And such is life for us. &amp;nbsp;I hope that you've enjoyed tonight's entry. &amp;nbsp;But now, I must ask a favor of you. &amp;nbsp;If anyone knows of a good software program that will let me create my own MP3 songs, please let me know. &amp;nbsp;(Make sure that it's under $100.00)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, a good excuse for you to Contact me.</content>

    <title>Three E's</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Head on over to &lt;/b&gt;the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blogspot.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I have a full write up on today's E3 events!&amp;nbsp; Much happiness today!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;








&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;@4:10pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; page &lt;/b&gt;has been updated.&amp;nbsp; Skip on over when you have a moment!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;







&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;@8:00pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Evening time, and I feel a cold &lt;/b&gt;bearing down on me like a deadline.&amp;nbsp; I really dislike this feeling, as I'm sure most do, because it only brings the assurance of further misery in the days ahead.&amp;nbsp; When the cold first hits, you feel run down, but not terribly so.&amp;nbsp; You can still eat normal food, at least.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
The last time I had a cold, I told myself that next time I got sick, I would take the opportunity to eat heartily before it really set it.&amp;nbsp; Why, then, can I only eat pizza flavored Goldfish crackers?&amp;nbsp; I had the inkling to eat something...but this is all that came to mind.&amp;nbsp; And they taste like Juicy Fruit gum, for some reason.&amp;nbsp; Ugh.&amp;nbsp; I hate colds.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On to better news, &lt;/b&gt;I found out late last night that the family has an opportunity to travel back to Lake Arrowhead next weekend.&amp;nbsp; Finally, an opportunity to MoBlog remotely in a place where most haven't been before!&amp;nbsp; For those not familiar with that region of California, I posted a few pictures over at the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Photography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section of the site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Those pictures are mainly placeholders for the time being.&amp;nbsp; After multiple trips, I have yet to produce any solid prints.&amp;nbsp; I'm hoping with a little bit of patience, I should return with something better.&amp;nbsp; And of course, there will be fuzzy cellphone camera pictures posted at the Moblah'g daily.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Come to think of it, all posts will be located at the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blogspot.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;during the trip, as I won't have any access to anything else.&amp;nbsp; I don't know why I'm typing this now.&amp;nbsp; There is still nearly 10 days until we leave.&amp;nbsp; Anticipation is sweet, is it not?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My mind is &lt;/b&gt;blank now, so I'll tidy up this post and bid goodnight to one and all.&amp;nbsp; The family and I will hop in the Fit and head on down to Blockbuster, I think...we're really enjoying the unlimited movie pass deal they have going.&amp;nbsp; During the past two months we've watched more movies that most people have in their whole life, I believe.&amp;nbsp; We've definitely watched more than we anticipated.&amp;nbsp; I could never get the hang of returning movies on time, anyway...they must have figured out that most people were like that when they obliterated late fees.&amp;nbsp; I'm truly grateful for that one, for sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Sumner always seems to think it's his turn to choose a movie though.&amp;nbsp; He'll probably keep that up until we've exhausted the entire Family and Children's movie section at this store.&amp;nbsp; That could take a while; we do live in East Freakin' Mesa.&amp;nbsp; Countless numbers of children here make for a big selection of cartoons.&amp;nbsp; We'll see what he picks tonight.&amp;nbsp; He's on a big Garfield kick right now, which is OK with me.&amp;nbsp; I coaxed him toward that title last week, it being one of my favorite shows from my childhood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And no, he doesn't seem tempted by the horrible CGI Garfield movie voiced by Bill Murray.&amp;nbsp; Wait.&amp;nbsp; I've probably just jinxed myself.&amp;nbsp; What have I done!?&amp;nbsp; Heaven help me if I have to sit through that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Wish us luck.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and I polished off the bag of pizza Goldfish.&amp;nbsp; Smooth.&amp;nbsp; Happy E3!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The wife has been looking extra-forward to this event.  I&amp;#39;ll just sit back in this ultra comfortable husband chair and type away while she tries on clothes.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try and post some pictures a little later of the surroundings and what-not.

    <title>A friend for Dobby (nope, not gonna happen)</title>
    <content type='html'>Today: &amp;nbsp;An extra special weekend edition of the blog, in all its glory!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I put some of the finishing touches on my Professional Web site today. &amp;nbsp;For any of you who may pass by this site, please tell me what you think! &amp;nbsp;Additionally, I would appreciate any word-of-mouth advertising that you could offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This morning, I left for Petsmart on my scooter to purchase Dobby some essentials, i.e. litter and food, and upon my arrival back at home, I found a small kitten outside of my door. &amp;nbsp;Coincidence? &amp;nbsp;I doubt it! &amp;nbsp;I took him inside, bathed him, tried to feed him (at least, I think it was a he?), and dried him all up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He attacked Dobby. &amp;nbsp;Wrong thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I took him to a shelter. &amp;nbsp;But now, I have a problem. &amp;nbsp;I want another kitty. &amp;nbsp; And I think Dobby deserves a friend too, with Wife and I being gone so often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, so please, refer someone to the site. If you want business cards, put in a request here, and I'll mail them promptly! &amp;nbsp;Have a good weekend!</content>

    <title>Three hour class</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Remember a couple of &lt;/b&gt;days ago when I crammed 12 pages of homework into one night?&amp;nbsp; Also, remember that I hoped for a "C" grade at best?&amp;nbsp; Those same papers were returned last night, and I got all "A's".&amp;nbsp; Fantastic.&amp;nbsp; Probably couldn't have received better news in class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Ah, but I thought I did.&amp;nbsp; Upon arrival at class, my teacher explained that he was in a terrible mood.&amp;nbsp; His left arm hurt and he hadn't had but three hours of sleep the previous night.&amp;nbsp; So, of course I thought that class would end early.&amp;nbsp; It didn't.&amp;nbsp; Instead, we stayed exactly one minute later than the full three hours.&amp;nbsp; Three.Hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I had some &lt;/b&gt;strokes of good fortune this evening.&amp;nbsp; I needed to find a few items to take into work, but the problems arose from the fact that I had not seen these items in nearly five months.&amp;nbsp; I searched high and low, as a person does at first, and gave up about 30 minutes into the search.&amp;nbsp; I attended to other tasks for the time being.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, my mind raced as I thought of possible hiding places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And you know where they were?&amp;nbsp; In the exact places that I had looked 30 minutes previously.&amp;nbsp; Isn't that the way it happens?&amp;nbsp; But my wife does know that I'm not the best at finding things.&amp;nbsp; It's just something that happened to me, I don't know when or why.&amp;nbsp; I simply pass over things very easily at first glance.&amp;nbsp; It's terrifying to think of whether I carry this thoughtless pattern over into other areas of my life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'm fairly &lt;/b&gt;exhausted.&amp;nbsp; Can't really keep my eyes open much longer.&amp;nbsp; It would be a unique happening if I tried to write one of these entries during day light hours.&amp;nbsp; ho knows, the quality might improve.&amp;nbsp; Well, goodnight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

A hike down revealed a rocky area populated by numerous reptiles. We steered clear of the obvious rattlesnake dorms and caught glimpses of quite a few lizards.</content>

    <title>Seven months, count 'em</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Man, I'm late.&amp;nbsp; I must catch up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Which, I might add, isn't a whole lot to catch up on.&amp;nbsp; Let's see, well...I can synopsize the past few days (48 hours) in a much smaller time frame (18 hours).&amp;nbsp; I worked.&amp;nbsp; And I don't really remember much other than that right now, I'm afraid.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Tonight, after visiting my wife at her job, I decided spur-of-the-moment to visit a few car dealerships on my way home.&amp;nbsp; Bad idea.&amp;nbsp; First, you don't just "drop by" dealerships.&amp;nbsp; You park, introduce yourself to Mike or Phil or Edwin or whoever.&amp;nbsp; Then they "invite" you into their wonderfully bright happy office, with 50,000 yellow balloons with smiley faces and banners with inexplicable numbers written all over them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Then they ask you to sit down (bad news) while they go get a "guest sheet".&amp;nbsp; I always give them bogus information.&amp;nbsp; Always.&amp;nbsp; Because sometimes, I just don't want Edwin knocking at my door, thank you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After a barage of personal questions relating to everything unnecessary, you proceed to all-defensive mode.&amp;nbsp; And then, for some baffling reason, these salesmen feel prompted to "talk to their manager."&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Why do you have to talk to your manager when I just informed you, three times, that I wasn't interested in buying anything?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What exactly do they talk about behind those great glass walls?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Why do they like to laugh so much?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I decided to take a gamble and see what they would say if I told them my budget was $35,000.&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly enough, they almost scoffed.&amp;nbsp; They actually pretended that I wouldn't get much for that price....that if I wanted a really family car, I'd be spending much, much more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And I really love that when you tell them you're interested in a different brand of car, they become extremely belligerent and inform you that you'd only get that car if it were A. Used and B.&amp;nbsp; Teal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So I have a new rule.&amp;nbsp; When they need to talk to their manager, I walk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Seven months&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Happy anniversary, sweetie.&amp;nbsp; You're the best.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
More later.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Speelcheker</title>
    <content type='html'>Much less to come tonight, I'm afraid...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's a fine thing that I don't promise much. &amp;nbsp;I read a few of my previous entries from over a year ago, and I tended to wax toward unfulfilled promises a bit. &amp;nbsp;Nearly every weekend, I swore to post pictures of my adventures, only to come back empty handed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that may change, as I hope to get a new digital camera for Christmas. &amp;nbsp;The empty promises strike back!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today crawled by, however the final hour of work was the worst part. &amp;nbsp;It was one of those days when you looked at the clock and swore that it hadn't progressed at all. &amp;nbsp;It even appeared to have taken turns at the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the days can inch by like weeks, because the weeks are speeding along like days. &amp;nbsp;I fear that one morning, I shall awaken in cold sweats. &amp;nbsp;I'll check the calendar, and realize it's only April 18th. &amp;nbsp;You see where I'm going with this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we needn't go there again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wow, speelcheker didn't go bananas over the word "needn't". &amp;nbsp;Is that truly a word? &amp;nbsp;I love English. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I'll teach it someday?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a good day! &amp;nbsp;Less tomorrow? &amp;nbsp;Nah. &amp;nbsp;More tomorrow. (not a promise)</content>

    <title>The Spirit Lands</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The seventh already?&amp;nbsp; The year is already speeding by.&amp;nbsp; What happened to the holidays?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Every year, I seem to have the same cooling-down period after New Years.&amp;nbsp; At times in sleepy stupors, I will wake up and completely forget the day and whether Christmas and New Year already happened.&amp;nbsp; I suppose this is unique to me, and it's probably an indication that I could use a little more excitement in my life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;News&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3855168/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Spirit landed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;...and it gave us 12 Megapixel photos!&amp;nbsp; This was fun news for me to read this morning, and even more enjoyable to view these pictures from another planet.&amp;nbsp; Let me repeat that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Pictures from another planet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's hard to grasp, is it not?&amp;nbsp; I've tried to visualize it...our little Martian lander strolling about on the surface of a planet 180 million miles away from where I stand.&amp;nbsp; And somehow, this little remote control car is beaming high-res full-color shots of the red planet's surface to Earth.&amp;nbsp; Come again?&amp;nbsp; Next thing you know, those NASA scientists will figure out how to bring one home...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
If you have the time, take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3855168/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;slideshow presented by MSNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In other news&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; I have a full three day weekend coming up, and therefore have planned a small adventure with my camera.&amp;nbsp; I hope to bring back more than a few worthy shots, having already promised my elder brother as much.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Wife went to the Doctor today, just a regular pregnancy check-up.&amp;nbsp; Everything looks ok, and next appointment, she gets to look forward to the glucose test.&amp;nbsp; I have here in front of me a strange viscous looking orange liquid.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, she must drink this entire sweet beverage on the morning of her next visit.&amp;nbsp; It just looks awful, and I feel bad for her.&amp;nbsp; I mean, isn't pregnancy bad enough without making these poor girls drink a strange orangey syrup?&amp;nbsp; I told her to take it on the rocks.&amp;nbsp; (joking)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
If you've ever wanted an archive of all of the pictures that I've placed on the Blog (and I'll bet you a pair of cheese straws you haven't), you can find one &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blogimage.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What a pleasure the Blog has been.&amp;nbsp; I appreciate those who keep coming back.&amp;nbsp; I'll see you again tomorrow, same place as before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>A note</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s Thursday.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; My gosh, how I hate Thursdays.&amp;nbsp; Funny how it seems to change in a flash.&amp;nbsp; Each week, no deviation.&amp;nbsp; Wednesday, I can go to bed feeling fine, but Thursday is remarkably different.&amp;nbsp; I desperately need a shave, but it’s too soon.&amp;nbsp; Friday will be worse, but at least it’s Friday.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, the next day is Saturday, and I can wake up and reset.&amp;nbsp; I’m also tired of shaving, but that’s what it takes.&amp;nbsp; Sharp razors and I’ll be all set. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m five years old.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;It’s 6am, well before school.&amp;nbsp; Mom lets me watch PBS in the mornings before I go to preschool at Mrs. Wing’s house.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Rodgers is speaking to me.&amp;nbsp; I love Mr. Rodgers.&amp;nbsp; He makes me feel safe and loved and ok with the world. He’s talking about the differences between boys and girls, but did I hear him say that boys could be girls?&amp;nbsp; Probably not.&amp;nbsp; But I go to bed that night and dream about waking up the next day a girl.&amp;nbsp; That can’t be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My sister has&lt;/b&gt; the coolest things in her room.&amp;nbsp; I love my toys too, and my mom is generous.&amp;nbsp; So I have almost everything!&amp;nbsp; Legos, transformers, He-Man, Hot Wheels, and lots of big blocks to build with.&amp;nbsp; But sometimes, I sneak into her room and look at her dolls and barbies.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and one time, we went to K-Mart and saw this wonderful Rainbow Bright doll on the shelf.&amp;nbsp; I wanted it so bad, and so did my sister.&amp;nbsp; She also has Strawberry Shortcake dolls, and they smell like real strawberry.&amp;nbsp; I have an action figure that smells, too, but he smells like garbage.&amp;nbsp; I prefer strawberry to garbage, frankly. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;I also develop a crush on several fictional characters, including Smurfette, Punky Brewster, and others.&amp;nbsp; When my parents would scream at each other, I would hide in my room and pretend they were taking care of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s 1st grade&lt;/b&gt;, and I love recess.&amp;nbsp; But I don’t like playing with the boys.&amp;nbsp; They just run around and chase and tackle and tease each other.&amp;nbsp; I much rather play with the girls.&amp;nbsp; We play house in the trees behind the school, and I am usually the baby.&amp;nbsp; I love how tender and sweet they are.&amp;nbsp; I love to go to their houses, too.&amp;nbsp; We play with their dolls and have parties with their stuffed animals.&amp;nbsp; But as I get older, my mom stops letting me play with girls.&amp;nbsp; That’s ok, I have a good friend named Jimmy, and he’s fun to play with.&amp;nbsp; We wander around outside and look for geodes and leprechauns. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m 8 years old&lt;/b&gt;, and my mom is taking me with her to the mall.&amp;nbsp; Again!&amp;nbsp; But that’s ok, I love the mall, and I love my mom.&amp;nbsp; She takes me to Crossroads and ZCMI center all the time.&amp;nbsp; I think it’s because my mom and dad are fighting.&amp;nbsp; They always fight, so we always go shopping.&amp;nbsp; It’s the way it works.&amp;nbsp; But, I do love it at the mall.&amp;nbsp; I find every excuse I can to go look at the girl clothes, but I don’t know why.&amp;nbsp; I feel kind of bad, because I’m starting to understand that people think that’s weird.&amp;nbsp; I heard on TV that transvestites got AIDS and hurt people and did drugs.&amp;nbsp; Is that what I am?&amp;nbsp; But I just want to touch the soft clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We’ve moved to Arizona&lt;/b&gt;, and I am 11 years old.&amp;nbsp; It was hard to leave my friends.&amp;nbsp; I didn’t have many, and one of them is really sick and might die.&amp;nbsp; But I have to leave.&amp;nbsp; My dad got a new job in Arizona, and he’s already gone.&amp;nbsp; My mom says I can visit Utah a lot, and that promise helps.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I like my new house.&amp;nbsp; I am alone a lot.&amp;nbsp; My sister didn’t end up staying in Arizona very long.&amp;nbsp; She went back to Utah to live with my grandparents. I miss her, but I don’t tell anyone.&amp;nbsp; She still doesn’t like me very much, because I am clingy and annoying. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When I turn 12&lt;/b&gt;, I start really learning a lot in church.&amp;nbsp; But one Sunday, we talk about boys and girls.&amp;nbsp; We have a combined activity coming up, and we are putting on a play.&amp;nbsp; And they say boys should never pretend to be girls, ever.&amp;nbsp; So all the girl parts go to girls, and I guess that’s ok.&amp;nbsp; But that doesn’t make sense to me, I think.&amp;nbsp; Girls wear pants and t-shirts all the time.&amp;nbsp; Are they pretending to be boys? Why are the leaders so mad at boys who want to wear dresses and wigs and play pretend?&amp;nbsp; They are being so serious.&amp;nbsp; I feel bad for being upset.&amp;nbsp; There must be something wrong with me, with how I feel. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;This happens again and again throughout the next few years. It causes me great shame and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am about 13 years old.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; My mom and I go to JCPenneys to pick out school clothes.&amp;nbsp; Not my favorite thing, because I think my mom is kind of annoying now.&amp;nbsp; Why do I feel that way?&amp;nbsp; Maybe because I am still alone a lot at home and I am tired of just talking to her.&amp;nbsp; She complains about my dad to me all the time and it makes me feel bad. Not just for her, but for both of them.&amp;nbsp; Why can’t they just talk?&amp;nbsp; If not talk, then just get a divorce.&amp;nbsp; That must be better than fighting all the time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;We are picking out clothes now, and I spot something in a rack next to me that I love.&amp;nbsp; It’s a pair of shorts, but they have tight biker shorts under neath.&amp;nbsp; It reminds me of something girls wear, and it’s feminine.&amp;nbsp; I can ask for this, right?&amp;nbsp; I gather up all my courage and sheepishly beckon my mom to come over.&amp;nbsp; I call her attention to the shorts and she sees what they are and says I can’t have them.&amp;nbsp; I don’t bother to ask why.&amp;nbsp; She wanders off and says something inaudible.&amp;nbsp; I feel bad.&amp;nbsp; I shouldn’t have asked for them.&amp;nbsp; They are stupid, anyway.&amp;nbsp; Boys don’t wear tight shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am growing up now&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I am an older teenager.&amp;nbsp; I have lots of good friends, both boys and girls.&amp;nbsp; I love talking on the phone, especially to girls.&amp;nbsp; But I talk to all sorts of people.&amp;nbsp; I find myself in a really good space where I am surrounded by people that love me and want the best for me.&amp;nbsp; My parents still fight all the time, and that does make me really angry, but at least I have my friends.&amp;nbsp; When my parents fight, I punch holes in my door.&amp;nbsp; There were a lot of holes in my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;My sister comes to visit from time to time, and brings friends with her.&amp;nbsp; They flirt with me and drive me crazy.&amp;nbsp; It’s all teasing, but it’s fun attention.&amp;nbsp; They are graduated from high school and have the coolest clothes and make up.&amp;nbsp; They let me talk to them while they are getting ready.&amp;nbsp; I love their perfume. I want to steal it! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;One day, I sneak into the room they are staying in while they are out shopping.&amp;nbsp; I am very careful. I do not want anyone to know I am here.&amp;nbsp; I look closer at their clothes, feeling each one and pretending to make outfits out of them.&amp;nbsp; I fold them gently and put them away just as I found them.&amp;nbsp; It makes me feel so happy, but anxious.&amp;nbsp; What if someone finds me? What if they notice something askew?&amp;nbsp; I would be mortified. I don’t ever want anyone to find out about me.&amp;nbsp; Every time I think about this, I remember what people at school said.&amp;nbsp; Boys like that were gay.&amp;nbsp; They were weird.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes they got beat up and teased.&amp;nbsp; And don’t forget about what the church leaders said.&amp;nbsp; But I’m not gay.&amp;nbsp; I love girls and am so attracted to them.&amp;nbsp; Not just because of their clothes or their bodies, but because of who they are at their core.&amp;nbsp; I don’t hate boys or men, but I am simply not attracted to them.&amp;nbsp; At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am 21 years old.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; I start a new job at Cox Communications, thankfully recruited by my good friend Peter.&amp;nbsp; We’ve been friends for about 5 years.&amp;nbsp; I feel like this is my first real job; good pay, benefits, and vacation time.&amp;nbsp; I have a huge team of people that I like to work with.&amp;nbsp; During training, I become friends with the trainer, Sam.&amp;nbsp; He encourages me and helps me feel like I have a future at this big company.&amp;nbsp; I feel singled out, but in a good way.&amp;nbsp; As we near the end of training, Sam invites me to a party at his house.&amp;nbsp; It’s for a lot of friends, and he says I should be celebrating the end of a grueling month of training.&amp;nbsp; I graciously accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;When I get to Sam’s house, on time as I like to be, it was unusually quiet.&amp;nbsp; No one else had shown.&amp;nbsp; I am welcomed in and offered refreshments.&amp;nbsp; One other person arrives, a younger man from work. I forget his name. He had blonde hair and was talking about a new movie starring Ben Affleck.&amp;nbsp; I ask where everyone else is; Sam says they are coming soon, not to worry.&amp;nbsp; Sam excuses himself into his bedroom for a moment, and comes back quickly with a stack of pictures.&amp;nbsp; “Here”, he says, and extends them to me.&amp;nbsp; They are all pictures of him.&amp;nbsp; He is naked.&amp;nbsp; I am startled beyond measure, and hand them back to him quickly.&amp;nbsp; I am embarrassed.&amp;nbsp; He notices it.&amp;nbsp; He says he thought I would enjoy them.&amp;nbsp; I ask why.&amp;nbsp; He said he assumed I was gay.&amp;nbsp; I ran out the door with tears in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;What on earth just happened to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I get married pretty young&lt;/b&gt;, and my wife is young, too.&amp;nbsp; My friend who got me a job at Cox starts acting strangely.&amp;nbsp; Almost competitive.&amp;nbsp; After a few months of this, he transfers out of our department.&amp;nbsp; I am oblivious.&amp;nbsp; During an off-hand conversation with a co-worker, she mentions that it was sad that my friend had to leave. I ask her why he had to leave, as he never told me anything.&amp;nbsp; Our friendship just seemed to dissolve, and because I was a newlywed, that’s what I chalked it up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;She looked shocked.&amp;nbsp; “You didn’t know?”, she asked.&amp;nbsp; I shook my head vigorously.&amp;nbsp; She told me he was in love with me, and couldn’t bear to be around me any longer.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else knew, too.&amp;nbsp; I felt awful for my friend.&amp;nbsp; He didn’t deserve this.&amp;nbsp; I am beginning to understand the vibe that I exude.&amp;nbsp; Am I embarrassed, unsure, or just incredulous? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meanwhile, married life&lt;/b&gt; continues on.&amp;nbsp; We appear happy.&amp;nbsp; We make a family, and that’s very distracting, isn’t it?&amp;nbsp; We have one, two, three children.&amp;nbsp; We have jobs and apartments and houses and school.&amp;nbsp; We’re very busy because both of our families live near us.&amp;nbsp; We try to travel and eat new things.&amp;nbsp; We don’t have a ton of money, but I never aspired to much, so I wasn’t really disappointed.&amp;nbsp; I usually had everything I could ever want.&amp;nbsp; And being so close to a woman all the time was very comforting. I push down any feelings that surface, because I don’t talk about that with her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then, years later&lt;/b&gt;, my world shatters.&amp;nbsp; She starts a relationship with a woman while we are married.&amp;nbsp; She says she’s a lesbian.&amp;nbsp; She says she hasn’t been in love with me in a very long time, and that I am exhausting.&amp;nbsp; It feels like there is a mountain on top of me.&amp;nbsp; I can’t breathe, and I can’t see straight.&amp;nbsp; I want to throw up all the time.&amp;nbsp; I fall into my own mind.&amp;nbsp; Why did she marry me to begin with?&amp;nbsp; As time went along, she probably figured me out really well.&amp;nbsp; I loved shopping and clothes.&amp;nbsp; Maybe she saw me as an option for marriage because I wasn’t overly-masculine.&amp;nbsp; Oh, God.&amp;nbsp; Did I turn her gay?&amp;nbsp; Was me being a more feminine person triggering for her?&amp;nbsp; She won’t answer me.&amp;nbsp; She won’t tell me when this started.&amp;nbsp; I can’t get any solid information to help my aching, aching brain.&amp;nbsp; I finally talk to my bishop, and he says all the words that I was so afraid of.&amp;nbsp; That she said I was an insensitive husband that didn’t care about her.&amp;nbsp; That she blamed me for everything, that it was my fault.&amp;nbsp; He didn’t explain the logic, but it all made sense in my addled brain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;This must have been my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;Months go by, and we separate.&amp;nbsp; We prepare for a divorce that I never saw coming.&amp;nbsp; Somedays, I feel like it’s all a dream.&amp;nbsp; Others, a nightmare.&amp;nbsp; I do better when my kids are around, and I have them 50% of the time.&amp;nbsp; But the days when they aren’t with me? I drown in sorrow.&amp;nbsp; I lay in my small apartment in anguish and non-stop tears.&amp;nbsp; I remember what Mr. Rodgers said about times when you felt mad and angry, and that you should cry into a pillow or pound some clay.&amp;nbsp; But my pillow is soaked, and I have no clay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I start to find things&lt;/b&gt; that make me happy, genuinely happy.&amp;nbsp; I begin therapy.&amp;nbsp; I work through some issues that I know were my own to handle, but I never dare divulge my tender feelings of femininity to my therapist.&amp;nbsp; So while I am working on things, I have a background feeling of disconnection, of impropriety.&amp;nbsp; I feel like a fraud, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;All the same, I learn that I am a person all by myself, without anyone else’s input or opinion.&amp;nbsp; I exercise, take myself out to eat, and travel.&amp;nbsp; I start shopping for myself, alone. I go to the mall and find myself in the women’s section.&amp;nbsp; A lot.&amp;nbsp; I find myself using any extra money I have to buy women’s clothes that pass well enough for neutral pieces that no one notices.&amp;nbsp; A lot of it is athletic wear.&amp;nbsp; Tank tops, pants, shirts…that sort of thing.&amp;nbsp; It makes me feel ok with myself. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;But there’s a strange contradiction happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The more I get&lt;/b&gt; in tune with the non-binary, feminine side of me, the more I am wrought with anxiety.&amp;nbsp; I have regular meetings with my bishop, and I tell him about it.&amp;nbsp; I tell him, point blank, “I like wearing women’s clothes, and I think it’s ok.”&amp;nbsp; He tells me it is not, and to stop immediately.&amp;nbsp; I spiral.&amp;nbsp; I stop taking the sacrament.&amp;nbsp; I punish myself for month and months.&amp;nbsp; Maybe a year.&amp;nbsp; Maybe more.&amp;nbsp; I take a trash bag and pile several outfits into it, crying tears of shame.&amp;nbsp; The bag goes to Goodwill.&amp;nbsp; I wake up the next morning and regret it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Months later,&lt;/b&gt; a miracle happens. My stake president calls me into his office out of nowhere.&amp;nbsp; He sits me down and asks me how I am doing.&amp;nbsp; I tell him.&amp;nbsp; I tell him everything.&amp;nbsp; He tells me to stand up and take courage, and to stop punishing myself.&amp;nbsp; I am ok.&amp;nbsp; He tells me I never should have stopped taking the sacrament.&amp;nbsp; But still, so many contradictions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I find it interesting&lt;/b&gt; that we are asked to follow the spirit so often.&amp;nbsp; He will lead us, guide us, let us know Heavenly Father’s will for us.&amp;nbsp; I feel His spirit so often, in so many places.&amp;nbsp; I feel ok much of the time.&amp;nbsp; It is only when I get back into the cookie cutter expectation mode of the organization of the Church that I feel odd and out of place.&amp;nbsp; It makes me uncomfortable, unwelcome, and disingenuous.&amp;nbsp; However, I stick it out because I know it to be true.&amp;nbsp; We are a bold church, a bold people.&amp;nbsp; However, we are fraught with prejudices and misinformation at every level of our organization.&amp;nbsp; We are taught how to feel about our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters without ever really getting to know them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;I love and sustain our leaders in the church.&amp;nbsp; I also know what a huge responsibility it is to be in charge of the salvation of hundreds of people.&amp;nbsp; I try to be diligent and follow their counsel, and I keep my covenants.&amp;nbsp; But I find the evolution of the church discouraging, as it is directly tied to my soul and who I am.&amp;nbsp; This isn’t me struggling with a tobacco addiction or spousal abuse.&amp;nbsp; This is something I was feeling as early back as my mind can take me.&amp;nbsp; So negative words matter to me, as they affect my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am a couple of years&lt;/b&gt; removed from my divorce.&amp;nbsp; I am finding success within myself and my job.&amp;nbsp; I am lonely.&amp;nbsp; I have dated several women.&amp;nbsp; Nothing works out.&amp;nbsp; Each break up is a little stab at my self-esteem, and because of my anxiety and remnant OCD, I begin to self-doubt.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I should stop shaving my legs.&amp;nbsp; Do they think that’s weird?&amp;nbsp; Maybe it’s weird. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s an entire movement&lt;/b&gt; going on in the background, as well.&amp;nbsp; In 2018 and 2019, there were women stepping forward, finding their voices and their power with the #metoo movement.&amp;nbsp; Men in power across industries were being brought to trial for their abuses of women.&amp;nbsp; This movement brought bravery to untold numbers of exploited women. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;It also caused untold trauma in my headspace, as I listened over and over to stories of women who were mistreated by men.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, I was involved in the revolving door of online dating, where each new encounter was an invitation by both parties to air their grievances, ad infinitum.&amp;nbsp; I listened to story after story of abuse, neglect, and infidelity.&amp;nbsp; This rhetoric caused a stirring in my soul that I hadn’t felt in a long time, a feeling of genuine disconnection from the body that I was born into. I could no longer claim manhood.&amp;nbsp; I no longer wanted to. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;But I also recognized the divine nature of womanhood and felt, quite strongly, that I could not appropriate that role or identity.&amp;nbsp; So I really start to dig deep.&amp;nbsp; I wonder about my eternal identity and my role in society.&amp;nbsp; I feel very strongly that I do not need to identify either way.&amp;nbsp; I find the term [non-binary], and it seems to fit my soul like a glove.&amp;nbsp; Still, I hold this information tight to my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In March of 2020&lt;/b&gt;, as the world-wide pandemic was hitting full-swing, I met a remarkable person.&amp;nbsp; She came into my life as if it were a wave of an ocean; there was unmistakeable power behind her every intention, but beauty and grace were at her core.&amp;nbsp; I knew from the inception that I must cultivate a genuine, honest, open, and heartfelt relationship with her from the start.&amp;nbsp; There were no compromises, there was no other option. I must be myself from the start and see if this miracle of a woman sees me for who I truly am. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;Miracles happen as we communicate.&amp;nbsp; I see hesitation from her, but never an ounce of it negative.&amp;nbsp; It was more like wearing a brand new shoe that is just your size, but a brand you are not yet used to.&amp;nbsp; She needed time to acclimate to this new normal.&amp;nbsp; There were times when I was frustrated with myself and vented to her, feeling the entire time that what I was saying was the final straw…surely she would run from me after learning this new fact. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;And yet, that moment never came.&amp;nbsp; She has only responded with more love, more understanding, more support.&amp;nbsp; She allows me the latitude to express myself genuinely whenever possible, and encourages me to speak to others who understand my situation.&amp;nbsp; We pray often, and seek to understand what this means for both of us.&amp;nbsp; We pray for our LGBTQ_ siblings here on earth, including those who walk paths outside of the norm or accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;We keep our covenants, and look forward to the future with hope.&amp;nbsp; There are still days of frustration, of silent weeping as the silence takes its toll on me.&amp;nbsp; I have moments of regret when I realize that this dear, sweet woman has born the brunt of my self-expression.&amp;nbsp; I fear a time in the future when people like me are not seen as freaks of nature or the realization of a prophecy of Satan on earth, because that means that the time was not for me.&amp;nbsp; That I was not brave enough to speak up more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 12px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;"&gt;I think…I think that is why I write this now.&amp;nbsp; Because I have to start somewhere, and that is here on this screen.&amp;nbsp; The words I write are true, and they are me.&amp;nbsp; 100% genuinely, authentically RyanDavid.&amp;nbsp; I am a child of God and I know that I have traits that have blessed my life and allowed me to survive this life on Earth.&amp;nbsp; I know that these challenges I have faced will allow me to help others in similar situations when the time comes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The sights, the smells, the entire environment was on point; nothing could be improved. The yellowing Ash behind the cabin was only a whisper. An overcast sky blanketed the village, prescribing rest and affection.  Thanksgiving is rapidly becoming my favorite holiday.&lt;p&gt;Lens: James M&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1935</content>

    <title>Ah, Sundays...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiweBPh_wba7pXXABZHOHFGtm3GptFOseNT94WlL1jxLENPx2DIrLIT9NYe9rijE-0JgvDQfIkf-0CZkC_DYQq4GE5Jz9sbB4-h1Lhy1t3YIpHg4dZvGLmb8u6N4eNa8dekGAdE/s1600/dobby_sleep.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiweBPh_wba7pXXABZHOHFGtm3GptFOseNT94WlL1jxLENPx2DIrLIT9NYe9rijE-0JgvDQfIkf-0CZkC_DYQq4GE5Jz9sbB4-h1Lhy1t3YIpHg4dZvGLmb8u6N4eNa8dekGAdE/s1600/dobby_sleep.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a welcome transition from the rest of the weekend. &amp;nbsp;I won't go into great detail, primarily because I wouldn't want to relive the exhausting parts, even in my mind. &amp;nbsp;Suffice it to say that Friday and Saturday were very, very odd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Odd: &amp;nbsp;Now that's a nice descriptor!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The picture up there; that's our cat. &amp;nbsp;I will never, ever devote even a single page to the silly kitten, because I don't want to come off as a crazy nut who carries their cat in a backpack. &amp;nbsp;But dang, that's a cool pose, and I hope he was dreaming about mice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Or catnip. &amp;nbsp;He likes that stuff.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I think he slept for like, 20 hours today. &amp;nbsp;Right now, he's just cleaning himself, because all that slumber must have made him filthy. &amp;nbsp;My brother told me to not feel sorry for him, ever: He said that cats have a knack at making themselves seem deprived and lowly. &amp;nbsp;That said, Dobby is one of the best.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Enough about the silly cat. &amp;nbsp;Wife is fine, house is fine. &amp;nbsp;Car still runs great, though it sounds like a helicopter at lift-off. (literary licence: I've actually never heard a live helicopter, let alone one during lift-off) &amp;nbsp;However, Wife and I feel that the Copter gives an accurate description of the sounds that it generates when we drive away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Other than that, I delve into the coming week in happier spirits than the last, the promise of Friday being pay day does an amazing job of making me smile. &amp;nbsp;And I should never forget that I have the best wife in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
By the way, we're into week 17 of the pregnancy now. &amp;nbsp;That's what, 4 months now? &amp;nbsp;Isn't this about the time that I should start preparing for the child? &amp;nbsp;Probably. &amp;nbsp;I wonder if he/she will ever read any of this...I'll be willing to bet that it will give a definite good look into my head during this time of transition.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
This entry is turning quickly into blather. &amp;nbsp;I really need to go to bed, anyway. &amp;nbsp;Like I said earlier, it's been an odd weekend...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I took a break from writing &lt;/b&gt;because I had nothing to write.&amp;nbsp; Plenty to write about now, so let's get started, shall we?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/"&gt;Apple redesigned their iMac.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/08/xbox-360-premium-confirmed-shipping-with-hdmi/"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;The XBOX 360 drops price, and adds HDMI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/08/wii-update-quietly-adds-limited-usb-keyboard-support/"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;The Wii got an update and came close to, but not quite, practical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20169917/"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;Bonds hit number 756*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (dang, that asterisk felt good)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Those are the things that sticks out in my mind.&amp;nbsp; Hmm.&amp;nbsp; Best to go through each one, then.&amp;nbsp; Here goes!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Apple.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Does anyone else think that &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is terrible?&amp;nbsp; It can't just be me.&amp;nbsp; Yes, this is a bit off topic from the iMac redesign, but still...it comes packed in now.&amp;nbsp; It's reminiscent of the keyboard on my Macbook, and I hate that keyboard as well.&amp;nbsp; Just glancing at the new keyboard gives me the impression that typing on it might be similar to a Speak N Spell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's obvious that Apple Inc emphasizes design over function; that point has been made for years, even when the &lt;a href="http://www.drunkenbatman.com/drunkenblog-archives/tang_ibook.jpgv"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;iBook resembled a toilet seat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their taste was gently forced upon us.&amp;nbsp; But they seem to have reached an impasse with design and quality; items such as the iPhone go far beyond the utilitarian mode and have delved into the realm of insanity.&amp;nbsp; Soon, they will be forcing us to control our devices with gestures.&amp;nbsp; I can only imagine the level of frustration, rising to the point where I throw it the bird and finally convince it to go into standby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Xbox 360.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I've been waiting for this announcement for a while.&amp;nbsp; Most analysts saw it coming, yet again, if enough of them sound their trumpet long enough, it all turns into background noise on the waves of the InterWebs.&amp;nbsp; When their predictions come to fruition, we can only nod in affirmation at the recollection that someone, somewhere thought of it before and it had to be "that guy".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyway.&amp;nbsp; So the Xbox, which I consider to be far superior in almost every way to the Playstation 3, received its first price drop since arriving in late 2005.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't go so far to call it a bargain...at $350.00, it's still way out of reach of most cost-conscious consumers (alliteration!).&amp;nbsp; Not only the price drop, but confirmation came late Wednesday that any unit built after July 4th, 2007 comes standard with the famed (and useful) HDMI port.&amp;nbsp; As the ubiquity of HDTV's marches on, the inclusion of this connection standard can only be a boon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Wii.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I came home on Tuesday night to the mellow beckoning of that cool blue light on the front of my Wii.&amp;nbsp; This could only mean one thing; an update was ready for download and I needed to jump on it.&amp;nbsp; I love the age of connectivity, where my devices receive new life-blood months and years after I purchase them.&amp;nbsp; With my finicky, impulsive buying habits, features that grant extended interest in gadgetry are great thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Alas, this update was mostly geared toward stability and thwarting piracy, rather than adding features like previous updates had been.&amp;nbsp; Still, a few neat things managed to squeak through, such as the aforementioned USB keyboard support and a more streamlined Virtual Console shopping experience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I'm still pretty hopeful that all of the things I dreamed about the Wii will come true; the Nintendo DS connectivity, downloadable demos, and DVD playback are just a few of them.&amp;nbsp; Nintendo has a good thing going with the Wii; let's hope they don't screw it up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgloc_W9Gbe_Xj1yh6vNuovK_t5AyX_QIEOgGha_LrQdkw9iz4P3YUAK2zJ4tVwGi5V5kj2Qsb-oF-H2ccQC14-xOCzqXgkY3a6Md3Z1vvIlI9WOulvtyZ5U6Bc-MRlfXO_NfEc/s1600/bonds_both.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgloc_W9Gbe_Xj1yh6vNuovK_t5AyX_QIEOgGha_LrQdkw9iz4P3YUAK2zJ4tVwGi5V5kj2Qsb-oF-H2ccQC14-xOCzqXgkY3a6Md3Z1vvIlI9WOulvtyZ5U6Bc-MRlfXO_NfEc/s1600/bonds_both.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;What a jerk.&amp;nbsp; I want this t-shirt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I don't need all of the stuff on the back, though.&amp;nbsp; I just need the 756 with the asterisk.&amp;nbsp; That'd be great.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I just don't get him.&amp;nbsp; I don't get professional athletes, to be concise.&amp;nbsp; Mr Bonds is the epitomy, nay, the embodiment of the loss of focus on the American fan.&amp;nbsp; Instead, it's a fascination with SportsCenter and Rome is Burning.&amp;nbsp; There's no publicity to these men.&amp;nbsp; Whatever it takes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And he's a liar too.&amp;nbsp; Boldface.&amp;nbsp; Times New Roman font.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And I don't really feel any empathy for the record, either.&amp;nbsp; People have had ample opportunity to speak up and make a stand against this debauchery.&amp;nbsp; True, it's not Hank Aaron's responsibility, but it's his record, and now it's gone.&amp;nbsp; Asterisk or not, the MLB let Bonds keep playing and will parlay judgment until after retirement.&amp;nbsp; Whatever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I have a few more things&lt;/b&gt; to say, but the hour grows late and my penchant for typing decreases with each passing minute.&amp;nbsp; That, and I really should pace myself and save a few articles for the weekend, when I actually have time for the Web site.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for dropping by, and if the tone of the blog seems somewhat somber, I apologize.&amp;nbsp; We've hit the home stretch of summer and I have a large vacation approaching, so my mind is elsewhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As always, the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blogspot.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands ready to satisfy your cravings for daily reading.&amp;nbsp; Head on over!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Snow all around</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Long day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Nearly half of it was spent at work, rather than the usual 1/3.&amp;nbsp; That never ceases to strike me as strange; we humans spend eight out of the 24 hours working.&amp;nbsp; I guess it all means something, though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The reason for the few extra hours today was a deadline that I'm working toward.&amp;nbsp; I've been told that my time management skills could use some work (who am I to argue?) so I'm definitely focused on attaining this.&amp;nbsp; I was only able to finish about 50% of what needed to be done.&amp;nbsp; More tomorrow!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When I drove&lt;/b&gt; to work this morning, I traveled on my usual route of the 101 to the 1-17, then exit.&amp;nbsp; But something caught my eye when I curved around the loop toward the 17; snow.&amp;nbsp; It was everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Each mountain range within eye shot was dusted with white.&amp;nbsp; It was absolutely beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I only wish that I had a camera at that moment.&amp;nbsp; Well, not at that very moment. If I had attempted to take a picture, the results could have been disastrous.&amp;nbsp; Photography and moving automobiles rarely mix, if ever.&amp;nbsp; But I did manage to take these with my camera phone later on in the day.&amp;nbsp; I sincerely apologize in advance for the terrible quality.&amp;nbsp; Truly, these images deserved better justice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKjswTKcfhLN0kx6Hyey-5WB0YE4Dn4YVw3i7dKmDy6xYWrci4VDjlgeHNEPm6VHF3wob6sj4ILWrsbdIX_oLeCjk69Qi46xVCZ5O00jmeGGXGiLZprTgG9UfXbV44QR2dgqJZ/s1600/IMAGE_00065.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKjswTKcfhLN0kx6Hyey-5WB0YE4Dn4YVw3i7dKmDy6xYWrci4VDjlgeHNEPm6VHF3wob6sj4ILWrsbdIX_oLeCjk69Qi46xVCZ5O00jmeGGXGiLZprTgG9UfXbV44QR2dgqJZ/s1600/IMAGE_00065.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Garbage.&amp;nbsp; You can hardly even see the snow.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, it's there, if you look really hard.&amp;nbsp; If the snow is still there tomorrow, I promise to provide better shots.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You might notice &lt;/b&gt;the absence of several links on the Web site lately.&amp;nbsp; It's all in preparation to reintroduce the site near the end of this month.&amp;nbsp; Also, many pages lack important functionality as my new host is making normal operation difficult.&amp;nbsp; My good friend Eric also wishes to blame Microsoft, but that's a given and I feel much better picking on something that I pay for on a monthly basis.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;School tomorrow night.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Therefore, few, if any, promises are made for an update to Wednesday's blog.&amp;nbsp; School just lays waste to my energy levels, especially after work.&amp;nbsp; At least it's an interesting class.&amp;nbsp; Now, if only I had a text book to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Does anyone else think the clover in the banner image is a little big?&amp;nbsp; I do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, I'm rambling now.&amp;nbsp; Time to end this.&amp;nbsp; Good day to you all!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS @ 9:54pm &lt;/b&gt;There are a lot of ways to get to old defunct areas of this Web site.&amp;nbsp; Do me (and yourself) a favor and don't get too click happy!&amp;nbsp; You might run into an interminable loop!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>Seeing how i work at Cox Communications, and that i &amp;nbsp;get 50% off all Pay-Per-View events, i ordered the Lewis-Tyson fight for myself and my friends. &amp;nbsp;We all know that "Iron" Mike Tyson is a felon, a half crazy loon that bites and head butts and probably doesn't deserve the attention that he gets. &amp;nbsp;He got pummeled tonight, a thorough thrashing by a more talented Lennox Lewis. &amp;nbsp;He got what was coming to him, and i didn't count on him winning. &amp;nbsp;So why am i so saddened that he lost?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is my only explanation: &amp;nbsp;I live in the past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I find it hard to let go of the things that i was brought up on. &amp;nbsp;Mike Tyson is a name, but with that name comes images and feelings from when i was a young boy, when i was fascinated by his power&lt;br /&gt;
and intrigued by his speed. &amp;nbsp;I saw his name everywhere. &amp;nbsp;I even owned his Nintendo game. &amp;nbsp;So naturally, i wanted to see him win again, not for himself, but for the child still inside of me. &amp;nbsp;When he&lt;br /&gt;
was knocked out tonight, it wasn't Iron Mike that didn't get back up. &amp;nbsp;It was part of my child hood. &amp;nbsp;I could care less for Mike Tyson the person. &amp;nbsp;It's the same way for me with basketball. &amp;nbsp;When Michael Jordan came out of retirement for the second time, i cheered silently because one of my child hood symbols had risen from the ashes to show that he was still The Greatest. &amp;nbsp;I didn't care that he might have been feeding his ego, or that he was only doing it because he was bored. &amp;nbsp;The truth is, he could still score 50 points, he could still take over a game when his body was willing. &amp;nbsp;It felt like a victory to me every time he stepped on that floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I confess that it's one of my problems that i refuse to believe that all good things must come to an end. &amp;nbsp;I find it hard to say goodbye to anything, really, and i keep a tight hold on the things that mean something to me. &amp;nbsp;I've had to say goodbye to blessed little in my life...i've only had 3 relatives die in my entire lifetime. &amp;nbsp;I'm 23 years old!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I guess i'm just old school. &amp;nbsp;My friends know i live in the eighties, for crying out loud. &amp;nbsp;My music? &amp;nbsp;I like it nice and retro. &amp;nbsp;My favorite basketball player? &amp;nbsp;Drafted in 1984, and he's still playing. &amp;nbsp;My favorite TV show? &amp;nbsp;The Simpsons, started in 1988, still in syndication. &amp;nbsp;The list really goes on and on. &amp;nbsp;Just be very glad that i dress normal and have no desire to grow a mullet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That will be all.</content>

    <title>Tucson was good for me</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
It was a chance to get away and recoup from the previous weeks' happenings. But i always hate coming back from somewhere fun like that, it's like eating 50 sugar packets and finding you have the energy to run up the wall across the ceiling, only to crash out of your high 35 seconds later and fall flat on your face in horrible spectacle. My friend Eric and I met up with some of his friends to go to an Ice Hockey game (and you may ask, what other type of hockey is there?) I dunno, i just always call it ice hockey. So anyway, we went to this ICE hockey game and U of A won, they were playing ASU so the whole arena was packed. Eric has some cool friends down there; Sara, Jaime, Dan, Erica, and others...i wish i could remember all of their names. So, hello to all of them. I doubt they'll even read this anyway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Work work work. I've been waiting to hear back from Cox Communications, i've desired a job there for months now. But no word yet, so i plug away at this fine engineering firm that i've been so blessed to be employed by. Other than that, there is very little going on in my life...although i've decided to go to California for a couple of days with my newfound friends from Tucson. It's almost been a year since i've placed a foot on that strange soil, it will be kind of nice to go back. I doubt that i'll even have any chance to see my friends there, much to my chagrin, but that's life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Check your house and see if there's a light bulb that needs replacing. Your eyes will thank you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Unless you stare directly at every light bulb in the house. Then they might get a bit sore after a while.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Use sunglasses. If anybody asks why you are wearing them, just tell them it's better than not not wearing them. After thinking about this for a while, they'll probably leave you alone...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Camping, part 1</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stay a while, I wish &lt;/b&gt;to tell you a story.&amp;nbsp; It's not a long story, but it is filled with happiness, embarrassment, laughter, disappointment, steak, and 150 miles of driving.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
First, the situation demands that I set the scene for you.&amp;nbsp; Allow me to elucidate.&amp;nbsp; My brother in law is departing for college in less than a week, which gave us this weekend as the last opportunity to go on a long awaited campout.&amp;nbsp; He and I don't deviate from the norm; we go to the same place each time.&amp;nbsp; Saves time and effort, see, we're too lazy to find anyplace else and heaven knows if they have a place to cook steak.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Which, I might add, is the sole reason for going on these adventures.&amp;nbsp; Steak hardly tastes better than when it's cooked over a fire.&amp;nbsp; And if dirt or charcoal happens to intrude upon it's seared precipice, so be it.&amp;nbsp; I will never turn down a steak cooked while camping.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Being the zealous campers (and grillers) that we are, we wanted to be prepared for a full evening.&amp;nbsp; We called upon two other friends to accompany us for the weekend trip.&amp;nbsp; Daniel and Andy are their names, they need no further introduction (as they will become integral parts of the story further below).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Daniel agreed that he would obtain the steak necessary for the campout.&amp;nbsp; Seeing that I worked until 6pm on Friday, I would have very little time to actually purchase anything.&amp;nbsp; However, I digress.&amp;nbsp; I did seek out the necessary firewood earlier that day during my lunch break.&amp;nbsp; As I related to each of them later that day, when I asked the friendly Home Depot representatives whether I might obtain firewood at that location, they proceeded to circle me about in raucous laughter.&amp;nbsp; I happened to be wearing a t-shirt that said "Albany", so one of the workers supposed I was from New York, and didn't know any better. I let him believe that supposition. &amp;nbsp;It was great until he said he was from there as well, and wondered what part I lived in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yes, it was 109 degrees outside that day.&amp;nbsp; But, I still needed the firewood.&amp;nbsp; Not happening at Home Depot, I left, tail between my legs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyway, where was I?&amp;nbsp; Ah yes, Daniel purchased the needed steak for me, and I was ever so grateful.&amp;nbsp; Silly me also forgot to tell my brother in law, Matt, that Daniel had agreed to get the steak.&amp;nbsp; So, of course, we had a double helping of steak for our journey.&amp;nbsp; How much steak could we have possibly brought, you ask?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nine pounds.&amp;nbsp; Count it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That was roughly 28 ounces per person.&amp;nbsp; Two and a half pounds, or so.&amp;nbsp; Give or take some ounces.&amp;nbsp; My math, she is no good, see?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Let's just allay any false pretenses and resolve to be honest, here.&amp;nbsp; Nothing went right during this entire campout.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I would not even call it a campout.&amp;nbsp; Here's why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We were all to pick up my brother in law on the way to the campsite, seeing as how he lived on the opposite end of the Valley than us.&amp;nbsp; We just figured it would save time.&amp;nbsp; That was what we thought, at least.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I asked him to meet us at the Wendy's restaurant at Pima Road and the 101 freeway.&amp;nbsp; When we got there, we noticed that there was, in fact, no Wendy's, so we proceeded three miles north to determine if it was slightly out of our way.&amp;nbsp; Nothing there.&amp;nbsp; We called him back, and to make (this story) short(er), we figured out that there was not one Pima exit, but two Pima exits, and he was at the one nearly 15 miles away from us.&amp;nbsp; Undaunted, we sallied forth to that location to obtain the final piece of our four-person puzzle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
By now, it was severe dusk, so we needed to make it to the campsite post-haste.&amp;nbsp; It was a car ride full of laughter and joking, with one of the jokes a passing thought that it would be hilarious if the campsite did not allow fires.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Let me say that it was &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; hilarious that the campsite did not allow fires.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Wait.&amp;nbsp; Allow me to add further color and context to this matter.&amp;nbsp; The sign actually read "NO FUMAR MADERA". For those of you who do not speak Spanish, that reads "NO SMOKING WOOD".&amp;nbsp; Great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This was one of those moments when I kept looking back at the sign, hoping to read a different message, or at least an additional message that would give us some hope for the ceremonious grilling of steak.&amp;nbsp; None ever came.&amp;nbsp; I decided to take the point at that point, and turned the car around to head toward Fountain Hills.&amp;nbsp; On the way there, we found another campsite, which was also closed due to the fire hazard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Can I say that Arizona sucks for camping?&amp;nbsp; Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Further along in our car ride, we passed through Fountain Hills, chowing down on Lay's potato chips, pork rinds, and Gatorade.&amp;nbsp; None of us wished to stray from our path to venture into the side roads of Fountain Hills to find a park with a grill. Although I did offer the sum of $25.00 to any passenger who would knock on a random door and ask the resident if we could borrow their grill.&amp;nbsp; Andy took me up on that offer, but I chickened out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For some reason, we decided to head in the exact opposite direction of where we were headed and drive to Mesa.&amp;nbsp; During this portion of our adventure, Andy began to wane as he lost hope of ever eating (or leaving the car).&amp;nbsp; He saw a sign that said "Cold Stone Creamery" and beckoned to us to head in that direction.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"That's the corporate office, Andy", I said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"You're telling me you think there's no ice cream there?", he retorted.&amp;nbsp; At that, the whole of us lost control and began laughing hysterically.&amp;nbsp; If this does not seem funny to you as you read it, it can only be because of the lack of context.&amp;nbsp; In other words, you had to have been there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We made it to Mesa in one piece, with several mentions of the fact that we were SO glad that we had nine lbs of meat in our trunk.&amp;nbsp; Actually, the number varied the entire evening, with numbers reaching as high as 983 lbs.&amp;nbsp; It honestly felt like that much meat.&amp;nbsp; The trunk felt like it was laboring my car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not to be detered from actually cooking this steak, we fired up Matt's grill in his backyard.&amp;nbsp; The meat that Daniel brought was so large that it did not fit on the grill.&amp;nbsp; I noticed at this point that the steak looked a little...marbled.&amp;nbsp; That's being kind.&amp;nbsp; These cuts had more gristle on them than meat.&amp;nbsp; Faithful that we would be rewarded for our efforts of the evening, I believed the majority of it would be cooked off and we would be left with the tender remains of rib eye greatness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Each one of us chewed through 27 ounces of fat.&amp;nbsp; There's really nothing else I can say.&amp;nbsp; It was horrifying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We each sat on the couch, one by one, utterly dejected at the final product of the nights' travails.&amp;nbsp; I looked over at Daniel, he returned the look and slouched further into the sofa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"I'm hungry", he said.&amp;nbsp; We lost it again.&amp;nbsp; Laughter rung through the house like a choir of recess kids.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, we got back in the car again and drove down the road, looking for anything that was still open (it was 11:45pm).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Finally, (and I mean FINALLY) we found a Village Inn that was still open and headed inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The waiter took our orders for breakfast, and we managed to inform him about a portion of our evening.&amp;nbsp; He summed it up quite handily for us when we were finished describing it:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"What were you doing with that much meat?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Again, the laughter broke through.&amp;nbsp; I looked around the restaurant and saw that the rest of the patrons were rolling their eyes at our antics, but we didn't care.&amp;nbsp; We had one of the most memorable nights in a long time.&amp;nbsp; This relation of this story simply does not do it enough justice.&amp;nbsp; I think we'd all agree that we'd do it again in a heart beat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, and Daniel:&amp;nbsp; I hear Impact Auto Body is looking for a new "mechanic".&amp;nbsp; Your attire in the car would be entirely appropriate for the interview that I scheduled for you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Where does Aquaman live?</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I forget.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Is it St. Patrick's day?&amp;nbsp; I think I may have blogged about this in past&amp;nbsp; years, but when I was much younger, my friend Jimmy and I would search the wooded areas near his house for leprechauns.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This was a tradition on each St. Patrick's Day.&amp;nbsp; We both would swear that we could see them darting throughout the trees, keeping their pots of gold or bubble pipes just out of reach of us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Because you know, back then the pipes only had bubbles in them.&amp;nbsp; What else could it be?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I probably shouldn't &lt;/b&gt;make this a terribly long blog tonight.&amp;nbsp; I fudged on my homework and writing this entry isn't exactly supporting my case for not doing it.&amp;nbsp; Plus, I worked nearly all day long on a Web site for work (yes, I know, I just said I don't like doing sites for other people, but this is work!) and I'm just plain tired to seeing FrontPage for the time being.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Interesting note:&amp;nbsp; "Frontpage" is categorized as a spelling error.&amp;nbsp; "FrontPage" is not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As this is the &lt;/b&gt;last blog for the week, it should be mentioned that it is to be another rainy weekend.&amp;nbsp; So, bring those umbrellas and hooded sweatshirts back out for one more rainy Saturday.&amp;nbsp; I hope you don't wash your car.&amp;nbsp; If you own a Prius, I'm not too worried about you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
If you don't know what I'm talking about, well, you're just not reading this enough, are you?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Office&lt;/b&gt; quote of the night:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
(How to get them to understand?) "Well, I'm like Superman, and these people are like citizens of Gotham City!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"That's Batman, Michael."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Ok, well, I'm Aquaman.&amp;nbsp; Where does Aquaman live?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"In the ocean."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Nerds.&amp;nbsp; I work with a bunch of nerds."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;End The Office quote.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Have a great weekend!&amp;nbsp; Monday it is, then!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Later on, I made it a point to pull away from our meeting for a moment to shoot it. &lt;p&gt;Wandering closer, I saw not only that it was in full spring bloom, it had not yet lost its autumn color completely. I tried to take a picture that would illustrate the contrast between the two seasons clinging to this tree when I noticed another element. &lt;p&gt;Dozens of bees were crowding the area, lazily hovering between branches. Normally, I would make haste and flee. But something about the casual nature of their flight endowed me with bravery. At least, until I perturbed them enough to provoke them. &lt;p&gt;I did manage to snap this picture before I left. After consulting with my dad and the Net, I&amp;#39;m still unsure whether it&amp;#39;s a wasp or not. &lt;p&gt;These trees better hope a late season frost doesn&amp;#39;t scatter these blossoms on the ground. Then again, we haven&amp;#39;t even seen the low 40s since December. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Helga Viking&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1935</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So they&lt;/b&gt; weren't lying, after all.&amp;nbsp; Their subs are A. Toasty B. Tasty and C.&amp;nbsp; They do have a pepper bar.&amp;nbsp; But it wasn't the pepper bar that I had expected.&amp;nbsp; For some strange reason, I believed that they had all sorts of exotic "shaking" peppers that you could use on your subs.&amp;nbsp; And well, since my wife has gotten me into really nice pepper, I was sort of excited.&amp;nbsp; Fine, I wasn't disappointed, I just now stand corrected.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Yes, they have a pepper bar.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjB5l2evVUISuv2tUK22CFdFeogYSh7AVUEPPJ0I0hfXWp_QTb6bwTymdvmdiSeP7kKT1pDVv55nWQPzS90YkSySriIR1visB_B6XU8AfwfQZPfM2BN_qrKnAMkvEyUISt4LRfP/s1600/toasty.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjB5l2evVUISuv2tUK22CFdFeogYSh7AVUEPPJ0I0hfXWp_QTb6bwTymdvmdiSeP7kKT1pDVv55nWQPzS90YkSySriIR1visB_B6XU8AfwfQZPfM2BN_qrKnAMkvEyUISt4LRfP/s1600/toasty.jpg" height="262" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
The proof is in the pudding.&amp;nbsp; Well, in the bread, at any rate...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I promise &lt;/b&gt;that this is my final entry regarding Quiznos.&amp;nbsp; And hey, we all got a laugh, I'm sure.&amp;nbsp; I suppose that it's only fitting that this strange adventure ends in the culmination of the visit to the restaurant.&amp;nbsp; Side note:&amp;nbsp; My wife thought that the place was cute.&amp;nbsp; It was, but it wasn't wholly original.&amp;nbsp; I'd seen cuter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On to bigger and better things.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Let's see...this weekend, there are many things afoot.&amp;nbsp; The buddies and I are planning on taking another camping trip to Camp Verde, perchance (&lt;a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/04/0304/030304.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sorry, James Lileks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) we'll visit the hot springs this time around.&amp;nbsp; I think i'll be braver this time and take the camera along for the adventure, as I saw many picture-worthy jewels in the wilderness that day.&amp;nbsp; One could spend an entire day shooting the mountains in that region.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Shortly after we return from the camping trip, it's all business from thereon out.&amp;nbsp; I have to meet with a company regarding a possible Web site design.&amp;nbsp; That should be interesting, and quite a positive experience if I may be so bold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sunday is slated for nothing but church and relaxation.&amp;nbsp; Monday?&amp;nbsp; Number 25 for this chap.&amp;nbsp; I haven't a clue what to do for that day, but maybe my wife will make more choco-crisps for me.&amp;nbsp; That's an entirely different topic for another day, keep in mind.&amp;nbsp; I'll be sure to elucidate further next week.&amp;nbsp; See you on Friday.&amp;nbsp; To remind myself, it'll be something about The Passion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Keep em coming.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So I have to dig into my reserve with this post.  With that said...&lt;p&gt;They say that good artists copy, and great artists steal. It&amp;#39;s not to say I think I&amp;#39;m either good/great, but I&amp;#39;ve definitely stolen this shot&amp;#39;s conceptual background. &lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t say who, but if he sees it, he&amp;#39;ll know. Let&amp;#39;s just say it&amp;#39;s an homage.  &lt;p&gt;Lens: John S&lt;br&gt;Film: Kodot XGrizzled</content>

    <title>Oh, now it's weekly?</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I guess this&lt;/b&gt; blog will simply have to become a weekly post.&amp;nbsp; I still haven't dug deep enough to find the dedication and self-discipline to draw more frequent postings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There is good news, though.&amp;nbsp; I finally updated the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/archive.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page with all 2006 postings.&amp;nbsp; So for any who have missed previous blogs, the entirety is accessible to you now.&amp;nbsp; Don't say I didn't warn you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It's week three of &lt;/b&gt;working from home, and I must say that I have mixed feelings of it entirely.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, it is wonderful to be able to relax in the morning, void of the rush and stress that accompanies the efforts of preparing for the commute.&amp;nbsp; It is also fantastic to be home; it is an entirely more serene atmosphere than the office.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But on the other hand, I find myself itching for a bit more engagement, a bit more involvement.&amp;nbsp; I need human interaction and it simply cannot be found while chatting with coworkers and management via Instant Messenger.&amp;nbsp; I think I'm disciplined enough for the task of working from home, but in all, I'm happy that I will be going back to the office in a few weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Other notables.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I had a fantastic dream last night that, despite waking up several times, continued on until the very moment I rose for the day.&amp;nbsp; I was sent one of 12 testing units for the Nintendo Wii (shudder, I still like "Revolution" better) and was able to actually hold the controller in my hand and play it.&amp;nbsp; It was a fantastically vivid dream in which I played Super Metroid 3 (that game I remember in particular) and a handful of others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Before I nerd-out on this blog and lose a large percentage of whatever audience I may have, I'll abstain from going much further.&amp;nbsp; And it is time for me to prepare for my two hour stint at the office, so I'll post more later.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Quite a while later.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I've already finished the day at work, and have since been to the pool with the little boy.&amp;nbsp; He's getting pretty confident; he really likes to go under the water and will even allow me to let go of him briefly.&amp;nbsp; I still think he has a ways to go before he can actually stop sinking to the bottom instantaneously, however.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But, progress still.&amp;nbsp; We're about to spend another fun-filled night over at the 'rents house, but what I'm really hoping is that I can coerce my elder brother into going to Best Buy with me.&amp;nbsp; He's three months shy of having his first child, and he hasn't a computer yet.&amp;nbsp; This will be important when he takes 300 pictures of his child and is unable to view/e-mail/print them.&amp;nbsp; This is my mission while he is here.&amp;nbsp; He needs to at least know what he needs before he leaves.&amp;nbsp; If I'm a truly talented brother/salesman, he'll leave Arizona with a new computer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Father's Day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Oh, I had a wonderful Father's Day.&amp;nbsp; Much of it was spent at my parent's house with the entire family.&amp;nbsp; My wife was lovely enough to get me the new Nintendo DS Lite, which is an upgrade to the existing DS that I already had.&amp;nbsp; I'm still getting used to it though, the buttons are quite different (read: mushy) and the cross-pad is a touch smaller.&amp;nbsp; But overall, it's a fine device and the screens are brilliant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's it for now, enough at least until next week.&amp;nbsp; Have a fine one, at that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Birthday</title>

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So, chickens can climb stairs&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We were awoken this morning by some peculiar and rare news.&amp;nbsp; My wife seemed to think it was mildly amusing, but if she only knew the quickening pace of my heart when she told me, she would have instantly known that she made my day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQfoMdjnkbmfWWvPRqpq9z32IDwHL32nHgCtuCcO_LCMWnnhWnQOks6Vl2WJVUqwTROFXQXIoDsssfHOFIJdPWDQAu9xM86kURcnSv3gt9ogj02S0JHUFItcAzk8VdxSDbO68O/s1600/chicken.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQfoMdjnkbmfWWvPRqpq9z32IDwHL32nHgCtuCcO_LCMWnnhWnQOks6Vl2WJVUqwTROFXQXIoDsssfHOFIJdPWDQAu9xM86kURcnSv3gt9ogj02S0JHUFItcAzk8VdxSDbO68O/s1600/chicken.jpg" height="320" width="192" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There was a rooster out in our front yard.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Maybe the only reason that I got excited was because it was genuine camera fodder, for there is blessed little to capture around an urban apartment complex.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The neighborhood kids were thrilled with delight; there were a few of them who were set on the idea of catching this lost bird.&amp;nbsp; But I could remember from my summer in Ephraim, Utah that it's not really possible to capture one of these birds without a little bit of formal training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The older neighbors were abuzz.&amp;nbsp; It seems we don't get much excitement around here, eh?&amp;nbsp; The apartment staff was there too, walkie-talkies in hand, wondering what to do about this rogue farm animal.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, one of the girls that worked at the office had a husband that knew a thing or two about these birds, and actually raised a few hundred in his life.&amp;nbsp; So he came straight over to get it.&amp;nbsp; That's fine, because I was growing weary of my neighbors jokes about a chicken dinner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQdWyXBzb46ptpsMdlgY-yxN2wlPJUNHduqcWc40Xciw5GjT0_UrXRq1KeuT8DxOAmPI6O42c5s2cteRxbuq9zTVnyvA2i44sWxUEbdu-9i9Fep-VQK37lUNiFUAp6dRVuSUpP/s1600/chicken2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQdWyXBzb46ptpsMdlgY-yxN2wlPJUNHduqcWc40Xciw5GjT0_UrXRq1KeuT8DxOAmPI6O42c5s2cteRxbuq9zTVnyvA2i44sWxUEbdu-9i9Fep-VQK37lUNiFUAp6dRVuSUpP/s1600/chicken2.jpg" height="244" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Last week, Quiznos.&amp;nbsp; This week, KFC?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In other news&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; It's birthday time, and I have the day off.&amp;nbsp; It's time to go shopping.&amp;nbsp; The wife got me some neat-o presents this morning, including a much-coveted propane lantern.&amp;nbsp; How'd she know that I wanted that?&amp;nbsp; Easy.&amp;nbsp; She's the best.&amp;nbsp; She also left early in the morning to get me my birthday cereal.&amp;nbsp; That is simply a tradition that cannot die.&amp;nbsp; Although it appears now that other families have jumped on that wagon, as my wife came home with a box of "Birthday Trix".&amp;nbsp; When I sat down at my desk to scribble off this entry, I was also greeted with an e-mail from my brother, wishing me a happy day with a Pay Pal present in tow. What a wonderful start to a wonderful morning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Poultry and sugared cereal, propane lanterns and active Pay Pal accounts.&amp;nbsp; What a day.&amp;nbsp; See you tomorrow!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Laziness</title>
    <content type='html'>"Hard Work Often Pays Off After Time, but Laziness Always Pays Off Now."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm sorry, but it's a little crazy how much time can be consumed by a simple web site. I even gave myself a dead line, and i thought that i would work along until the moment of the release. Well, that didn't work out as planned, and instead, i waited until the very last moment and then!!!! i worked like gangbusters to get the page finished by October 1st.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It happened in high school, it happens in college, and by golly, I'll do it in my spare time too...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving along, I'm really quite glad to get this done. The colors are solid, the pages are expandable and the design seems to go well with what i have. But trust me when i say this: It will be the last site redesign for at least....50 years, I'd imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speechless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It still bugs me...the spell check in Microsoft Word still has no clue how to auto-correct the word "I'm" when I misspell it. This wouldn't be so bad, I guess, but you have to take into consideration the alternatives that it gives you in place of our oft-used contraction. The first word on this list, well it's:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still speechless. Help me, Webster. What is an Imp?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
a : a small demon : FIEND b : a mischievous child : URCHIN&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, let's take this into context!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Imp taking a greyhound, or the Hudson River Line...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imp in a New York state of mind."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you, Microsoft Word. Let me know when you've realized there are no Imps in a New York state of mind. Actually, having been there, there may be. I take it back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, much has evolved on my little site. You will notice that I've redone the entire menu system...I realized that my menu buttons, while nice at first, demonstrate very little about what I've learned of designing websites. I've long coveted a simple drop down menu system, and have finally realized this goal. Now, I guess it's time to move it to every last page in my site. I know there must be a much simpler way, but Imp just not ready to read up on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So anyway, thank you a billion times for visiting the site and reading all of this nonsense. I'll always appreciate it, and you're always welcome to drop by anytime. Till next time!</content>

    <title>Just great news</title>
    <content type='html'>No tricks tonight, just great news.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We finally know what it is. &amp;nbsp;After weeks of waiting, Wife and I had our second ultrasound to determine the gender of our baby. &amp;nbsp;We awoke early, around 6:00am, as our appointment time was at 7:00 and we needed to be there early.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we arrived, the sun was barely rising over the eastern mountains. &amp;nbsp;There was a definite chill in the air as I led her up to the building. &amp;nbsp;We were both excited, but neither of us wanted to admit that we were nervous, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we walked into the doctor's office, I asked the receptionist if we should proceed directly to the ultrasound or wait here for the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"You don't have an ultrasound scheduled for today, I'm afraid", she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I then informed her that there must have been some mistake, as the doctor told us that he would make sure we found out during the next appointment. &amp;nbsp;She was very stern with me, and told me that there was no possible way that we could have our ultrasound today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heartbroken, we took our seats in the lobby and waited for the doctor to call us in. &amp;nbsp;My wife didn't say a word, but the look in her eyes told me exactly how she felt. &amp;nbsp;The poor thing was heartbroken!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, when we talked to the doctor, he informed us that he would work his magic and make sure we were scheduled in at 8:00am for the ultrasound. &amp;nbsp;Pure excitement!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We waited another hour, watching the Today show on the television in the lobby. &amp;nbsp;It must have done a great job of distracting me, because I didn't feel nervous again until they called my wife's name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We walked together back into the ultrasound room, holding hands and breaths. &amp;nbsp;I nervously asked the nurse if she thought that we'd be able to know what it was, she reassured us that we should have no problem finding out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As she touched the wand to my wife's tummy, I glanced at the tiny screen to the side of us. &amp;nbsp;I watched in wonder as this tiny being rolled around inside my wife. &amp;nbsp;"Just get to the good part", I said to myself. &amp;nbsp;I had hardly thought this when I realized I should be enjoying this moment, I should really experience the whole thing, and not just the penultimate moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that moment finally came. &amp;nbsp;She told us what it was, and we both looked at each other knowingly. &amp;nbsp;We both knew it from the start, yet we were still so surprised and happy. &amp;nbsp;Basically, any positive and wholesome emotion was felt at that moment in time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, just four little months left. &amp;nbsp;We await his arrival with great anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>English lessons</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;English lessons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As a rule of thumb, you should never try and persuade rules of writing without proper research.&amp;nbsp; My wife taught me this important lesson earlier tonight.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that I may know something about writing, but I have a difficult time expressing where I learned it from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It all started when I asked her to make sure and proof this Blog for me, as she is usually the first to read it.&amp;nbsp; She told me she would, and already had something in mind.&amp;nbsp; She pointed out a good one.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday, I quoted Kobe Bryant as saying "just not right."&amp;nbsp; For good reason, she told me to take the period out of the quotes and end the sentence on the outside of the statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But sometime ago, I learned that commas and periods remain inside of the statement at the end of a sentence, and exclamation points and question marks are placed on the outside.&amp;nbsp; She proceeded to take out her Psychology book to show me several examples of period usage outside of the quotes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Unsurprisingly, I became flustered because I felt that years of habit were crumbling before me.&amp;nbsp; Not willing to give up, I googled the phrase, "quotation mark and period usage" and &lt;a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~wbecker1/style/punctuation.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;found the following page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn't necessarily declare victory, as success is generally derived from hardened dedication.&amp;nbsp; I'd give the victory straight to her, as her quiet patience taught me a lesson, as always.&amp;nbsp; What a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Star Trek II.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;After the results of the previous Star Trek viewing, I had cast off all thought of my wife agreeing to watch any further installments of this series.&amp;nbsp; But we did end up watching the second film tonight, and it made me remember that this one was probably my favorite.&amp;nbsp; The story of Khan is excellent, and there was enough plausible drama to keep us both entertained for the entire movie.&amp;nbsp; Gone were the long segments of elaborate homecoming; instead, the entirety was driven by the storyline.&amp;nbsp; But I'll pass on the full review for tonight.&amp;nbsp; I'm much too tired for that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Baby shower tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;It's hard to believe that we've come this far already, the preparations seemed so far off for this event.&amp;nbsp; I've distanced myself pretty well from the occasion, partly out of jealously, mainly out of frustration.&amp;nbsp; But I'm sure that the wife will have a great time, and she sure deserves all the neat things she'll undoubtedly get.&amp;nbsp; I'll be sure to list a few of the more memorable items tomorrow, as the week is retiring quickly and I'm running out of material.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Until then, keep the fire hot.&amp;nbsp; We'll see you again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Burrito Bandito</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It's no small &lt;/b&gt;accomplishment that I'm actually going to post this blog before 11:00pm; every other night has been posted at that hour or much, much later.&amp;nbsp; Blame school, blame work, and blame...well, myself of course.&amp;nbsp; But tonight, there are far more important things than the blog.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Burrito Bandito.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;This is a small Mexican restaurant that I found near my place of work, and I love it.&amp;nbsp; For $3.78 with tax, I can get a sizely bean and cheese burrito, a half order of Baby Banditos, and a drink.&amp;nbsp; Believe me, it fills me up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And for the third day straight, I have a picture!&amp;nbsp; 'Cept this picture isn't of a sunset, labyrinth, or other such amusements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
No.&amp;nbsp; It's my lunch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWayubh-7u0xj2Rz4aTtjZc5VmDkWASwIdBPzI1Ue3Qp8HNHY9SQyWq13m5FnEtIaCCFNwUBs67mZ6_2SKMEAdL3uridFjpEYzyOFg4X2E6_gsECXVBI_yTn8gYyLtNNGkRCtE/s1600/IMAGE_00003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWayubh-7u0xj2Rz4aTtjZc5VmDkWASwIdBPzI1Ue3Qp8HNHY9SQyWq13m5FnEtIaCCFNwUBs67mZ6_2SKMEAdL3uridFjpEYzyOFg4X2E6_gsECXVBI_yTn8gYyLtNNGkRCtE/s1600/IMAGE_00003.jpg" height="253" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Looks tasty, doesn't it?&amp;nbsp; I don't know what came over me when I took this picture.&amp;nbsp; I was not particularly impressed with the presentation; forgive me, but I'd seen this plate on numerous other occasions.&amp;nbsp; I just wanted to take a picture of my lunch, and let everyone see it.&amp;nbsp; And I wanted to tell you to try The Burrito Bandito.&amp;nbsp; It's at 19th Avenue and Union Hills Road.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.burritobandito.com/"&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Technically, the last time I took a picture of my food was in the Missionary Training Center when I was 19 years old.&amp;nbsp; I would regularly take pictures of the grand portions there; after developing them (remember doing that?) I would send them to my parents, either as proof that I was eating or, more likely, to be completely obnoxious.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sheesh.&amp;nbsp; It's been quite&lt;/b&gt; a week.&amp;nbsp; This is it until Monday, I hope that you have found this week's postings slightly amusing, if not bemusing.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it truly is confusing to go from picture of post-rain sunsets to a styrofoam plate full of fried Mexican food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But what can you do?&amp;nbsp; Meet me back here on Monday and I'll try to make it up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Brand New Day</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;Just thinking back to the year 2000; things seemed to be happening and disappearing at the same stroke of the master's brush. &amp;nbsp;I leaned heavily on music to create a mood around me. &amp;nbsp;Moving from the 1900's to 2000's seemed so momentous back then. &amp;nbsp;In Sting's words, regarding the song Brand New Day:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;"I wanted to write an optimistic song about love that began in one place and ended up in another... I used the symbol of Y2K as a symbol of beginning again. Turn the clock to zero is an interesting symbol. A symbol of rebirth."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;"&gt;I'm wondering; ought I to pine for a time far gone? &amp;nbsp;Can rebirth occur at any time?&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>04/15/09 - Salt. The boy loves salt.</title>
    <content type='html'>I've always known that Sumner likes salty foods.  As soon as he was young enough to reach the salt shakers at restaurants, he has tried his hardest to put sodium on everything he eats*.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday evening, I set myself to task with the weekly laundry duties, while putting SaraJane down for a nap and turning a movie on for Sumner.  It's acceptable to me that Sumner can choose a snack for himself from the shelf he can reach, usually a granola bar or some fruit snacks.  Instead of one of these more sensible choices, Sumner decided to take it upon himself to scramble up the rows of shelves to find an entire bag of pretzels, one of his favorites.  I have nothing against them, however; Sumner has no portion controls skills yet, especially when tuning out to a movie.  So, unbeknownst to me, Sumner whiled away the time snacking on the whole bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the movie was done, he ran upstairs to greet me and see if I needed any help  with the laundry duties (good kid, afterall).  I said no, but that we should go back downstairs to clean up.  It was then that I found the empty bag, and more purposeful to the story, it was then that Sumner decided to vomit abundantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be noted that Sumner is a good sport, and realized the error of his ways even while throwing up the consequence of his snacking indulgence.  He looked up at me and said, quite matter-of-factly, "I had too much salt, I think".  I agreed with him, and continued on cleaning up the mess he made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much later that evening, while discussing the event with the wife, Sumner gave me further revelation into his snacktime adventures.  Seems that Sumner didn't stop at the end of the bag, oh no.  He decided that waste not, want not, and ate every grain of salt left over in the bag.  The boy.loves.salt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If possible, next time you have an empty bag of pretzels, check and see how much salt is left in the bottom.  Then picture a five year old boy eating all of it.  Then imagine my gratitude that Sumner did end up puking it all out.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pretty grand adventure in the world of parenting, indeed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*No, we don't let him.  Though he still tries to angle himself toward the salt shakers at every restaurant we go to!</content>

    <title>Waiting, wondering</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We're waiting &lt;/b&gt;for Sumner to fall asleep.&amp;nbsp; I'm glad that I learned the lesson of ritualistic living,&amp;nbsp; otherwise I may have lapsed into a coma long ago.&amp;nbsp; Besides, one can come up with enough variety to spice up life if they try hard enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For a third day in a row, I've been allowed to leave early from work.&amp;nbsp; While this does not afford me a full day's pay, it has been enjoyable to taste the "early release" again.&amp;nbsp; To those still in grade school, cherish those days forever.&amp;nbsp; Go get a slice of pizza instead of going home and watching television.&amp;nbsp; I dunno.&amp;nbsp; Fly a kite or something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
In the next room, I can vaguely hear my son moaning wearily.&amp;nbsp; He's so tired that he cannot fight it any longer.&amp;nbsp; But still he must make some amount of noise.&amp;nbsp; I'm willing to wager that he's asleep by the end of this blog.&amp;nbsp; Man, that really does sound sad.&amp;nbsp; But at least it's not a full cry...yet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Other things worthy of mention:&amp;nbsp; We moved out of our old abode into a new apartment.&amp;nbsp; We did it completely sight unseen.&amp;nbsp; As we figured it, anything was better than the place we had dwelled previously.&amp;nbsp; The simple joy of not hearing 56 motorcycles on their way home from mechanic school at 11:30 at night is unspeakably poignant.&amp;nbsp; To no longer have a street sign lighting up your room is equally wonderful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There.&amp;nbsp; I believe that Sumner has drifted away into slumber ok maybe not.&amp;nbsp; Just like that a sleeping baby becomes awakened by the slightest noise...in this case, perhaps a leaf fell to the ground outside.&amp;nbsp; That must measure as a 7.8 on a baby's auditory Richter scale.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it was nothing more than a passing thought that kept him awake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But without language, what are his thoughts like?&amp;nbsp; Images, probably.&amp;nbsp; Colors, sounds, and memories of the day.&amp;nbsp; Much like his daddy's dreams, except much less filled with thoughts of money and basketball.&amp;nbsp; Those don't go hand in hand except when trying to come up with something interesting to write about.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I've also reenrolled in school, and am about half-way done with the semester.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be; however, taking abstract classes such as Psychology and Sociology is a disaster.&amp;nbsp; Those classes are especially dangerous to take online if it is your first venture into the online setting.&amp;nbsp; Online classes often leave you with but one recourse...that of reading the entire text book and hopefully gleaning the correct material for your quizzes and tests.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I think it premature to say that I despise online classes, and even would admit that there will be many more to come.&amp;nbsp; But I long for a regular classroom.&amp;nbsp; One where discussion and questioning of material is second-hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sumner is quiet now.&amp;nbsp; Time for his daddy to find a peaceful time of things.&amp;nbsp; Goodnight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>04/27/09 - RD Tested: Why the Hackb00k is a success</title>
    <content type='html'>I&lt;img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-55 alignleft" title="photo-33" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/photo-33-150x150.jpg" alt="photo-33" width="150" height="150" /&gt;n response to &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/04/27/road-tested-why-the-hackb00k-is-a-fail/" target="_blank"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, (link opens new page, as well as explains what I'm arguing against) I can say only this; it’s truly a matter of opinion.  Therefore, I am completely aware that what follows is simply my take.  But I'm pretty sure I'm right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I kid.  I am not putting the article’s author down in any way when I say that I wholeheartedly disagree with his viewpoints on a perfectly functional piece of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am speaking about my recently hacked Dell Mini 9 netbook, which was transformed almost magically into a fully functional Macbook Mini.  At only 2.5 lbs and a diminutive form-factor, it is the perfect tool for me whenever I leave the house.  In fact, it routinely stays with me while in the house, as well.  Having been a blogger for the past seven or eight years, I can say this laptop is the best tool for the trade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="iPhoto does run, just barely"]&lt;img class="  " src="http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3357/13/66/1220240335/n1220240335_1292087_1093029.jpg" alt="iPhoto does run, just barely" width="300" height="225" /&gt;[/caption]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author is correct in stating that you do get what you pay for.  This machine is not a Macbook, neither in terms of performance, nor its capabilities.  I cannot successfully navigate my stash of nearly 10,000 photos in iPhoto without the machine giving up and either freezing, or throwing 4,000 errors into the wild.  (This is not hyperbole; when iPhoto last locked up, I opened the error console and saw 4,000 errors waiting for me, generated within the past two minutes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will be perfectly honest, I had not personally owned an Apple computer before (though, my wife had).  I was really excited at the prospect of having this machine run OS X.  I stretched this computer further than it should have gone, but that is not the fault of the machine.  I get the feeling that the blogger over at TUAW was guilty of the same sin, but to a much more extreme degree.  Therefore his disappointment was all the more keenly felt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300" caption="The Hackbook next to a Seagate Free Agent Go"]&lt;img src="http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3357/13/66/1220240335/n1220240335_1292078_1344452.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /&gt;[/caption]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;To his argument that the trackpad gestures do not work, I say this; it’s not an Apple machine, and for someone who already owns several several Mac products to say this is disappointing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;The size of the included SSD hard drive is diminutive, and like TUAWSteve said, it is not sufficient for installing every program that you could possibly need.  But again, used as a blogging tool, all you really need is a decent word processing program and the ability to browse the net.  If more space is needed, purchase an external hard drive and/or a larger SDHC storage card.  I have already done the former, and plan on purchasing a 16gb SDHC card for a compacted version of my iTunes music library. (Because it’s important to have music while you type!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="272" caption="Who&amp;#39;s a good netbook?  Yes, you are!"]&lt;img src="http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v649/13/66/1220240335/n1220240335_1292080_3418507.jpg" alt="" width="272" height="362" /&gt;[/caption]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I am still extremely pleased with my hacked Dell Mini 9 netbook, and here’s why.  The joy was in the journey!  I love messing around with technology, and love being able to make it do things that it originally was not intended to be used for.  Believe me, the thrill of turning on the machine and seeing the Apple OS X boot screen has come and gone, but the usefulness and intrigue of the machine lives on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should also be noted that I do not share TUAWSteve’s view that Apple is indeed working on their own version of a netbook, at least a netbook as far as the world defines it at this point.  Timothy Cook, Apple’s COO, was correct;  current netbooks are cramped, are limited in their use, and come with terrible software.  I don’t envision Apple moving away from their core at this point just to create something that the masses seem to be taking a liking to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;The popularity of Netbooks will eventually wane, and I think it’s a justified end, simply because it is such a niche product for a niche economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as for me, I am glad that I purchased and hacked my Dell Mini 9.  I think it’s rather ironic that I did so at the recommendation of the same blogger who has now turned his back on the entire experience!  I intend to continue using this machine for most of my blogging needs, and look forward to taking it with me on my trip to Utah this week. &lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>A thought</title>
    <content type='html'>I am out of practice, it seems. I used to find such relief in this web&lt;br&gt;site, and though the core of that feeling still surfaces from time to&lt;br&gt;time, I can&amp;#39;t help bit notice the lack of passion in my writing.&lt;p&gt;Every sign in nature tells me that it&amp;#39;s partly a temporary phase in&lt;br&gt;life. The other part of the puzzle eludes classification for the time&lt;br&gt;being. I want to begin writing again. And not just more often, but&lt;br&gt;full-time. I want nothing more than to find a way to earn a little&lt;br&gt;scratch from this site someday soon.&lt;p&gt;My job drives me crazy, in other words. It&amp;#39;s the underlying current in&lt;br&gt;most of the thoughts of my life right now. I&amp;#39;m not miserable anymore,&lt;br&gt;for what that&amp;#39;s worth. But I just don&amp;#39;t derive the same satisfaction&lt;br&gt;or otherwise from my pursuits in the office. It all feels incredibly&lt;br&gt;empty and callous. Then again, I do realize I&amp;#39;m looking for meaning in&lt;br&gt;something that most people just do out of social obligation and&lt;br&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t really take it all to heart. Maybe. Maybe not!&lt;p&gt;My arms are getting tires, as the baby is asleep on my chest right now&lt;br&gt;and I&amp;#39;m typing upside down with my arms extended above me. Excuse the&lt;br&gt;length. More to come later!&lt;p&gt;RD Burningham&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone</content>

    <title>Trade-offs</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The monsoon storms &lt;/b&gt;seem to have abated for the time, and the temperatures have soared right back up into the unbearable zone.&amp;nbsp; I knew I should have enjoyed the cooler weather while it was here.&amp;nbsp; Though there was a day about a week ago when we had a freakish amount of rain in a short time span.&amp;nbsp; I told Sumner to go enjoy it.&amp;nbsp; He had a blast!&amp;nbsp; Too bad daddy had to stand back and take the pictures though.&amp;nbsp; That's always the trade off: enjoy the moment or archive the memories.&amp;nbsp; I chose the latter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPyC5ycVoFzphyphenhyphenheiY-V-JjCJrNgcAG70BPwwSzVQTvLgSAbq6gqIV85NhyBhN9foxNjJ4Pjo6q8gnb0Vy5HhyphenhyphenDy8klGqcIbTqWOLfNhNHxux5vMUPdW9oGlgGkjPwUATK3LC3/s1600/IMG_1090.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPyC5ycVoFzphyphenhyphenheiY-V-JjCJrNgcAG70BPwwSzVQTvLgSAbq6gqIV85NhyBhN9foxNjJ4Pjo6q8gnb0Vy5HhyphenhyphenDy8klGqcIbTqWOLfNhNHxux5vMUPdW9oGlgGkjPwUATK3LC3/s1600/IMG_1090.JPG" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/IMG_1090.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I came the the conclusion earlier tonight that I ought to enjoy my time more fully.&amp;nbsp; Whatever predilection I was endowed with that provides me with reactionary statements such as "I'm so busy" must be stopped, at all costs!&amp;nbsp; I'm tired of feeling busy.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it's about time I figured out that I'm not busy, really...not at all.&amp;nbsp; 24 hours in a day is a lot of time to enjoy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh sure, I can be genuinely busy at times.&amp;nbsp; But it seems that we humans feel like an absolute waste when we aren't actively engaged and able to respond as such.&amp;nbsp; Trouble is, some of the activities we occupy ourselves with is pure garbage that is best left alone.&amp;nbsp; Time could be better spent with family and friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's wonderfully healing doing nothing every once in a while.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps if we spend a little more time unwinding and meditating, we can find ourselves in a better position to tackle the demons that appear throughout the week.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's the reason why I do this blog...I don't feel obliged to do it, I just write because I love to do it.&amp;nbsp; It lets me reflect a bit more on the environment around me and the way that I am connected to it.&amp;nbsp; Believe me, the employment that I choose does not, in the grand scheme of things, make a bit of difference.&amp;nbsp; So then why do I spend so much of my time at home preoccupied with the generalities of the function?&amp;nbsp; Rather, my time could be better spent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The people I talk to at work, the relationships I forge, the words I speak and listen to...those matter a great deal to both me and others.&amp;nbsp; And I don't think I give those special moments enough consideration in my life.&amp;nbsp; My job itself matters only as it is a vehicle for me to provide service to others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We spend too much time working as it is.&amp;nbsp; Do I really want a job where I work 65 hours/week?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; I assert that it must not be that way now, nor must it ever become that way.&amp;nbsp; They say that no success in the professional life can compensate for failure at the home front.&amp;nbsp; I think that can be applied to other areas of life, as well.&amp;nbsp; Work is what sustains us, gives us our daily bread and provisions for our family.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is not meant to be a replacement for or a threat to the main functions of our life, which are family, love, friendship, meditation, and education.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm not sure where I'm going with this.&amp;nbsp; I certainly didn't intend to end up there when I began, that's for sure.&amp;nbsp; But I'll leave it as is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Last weekend went off pretty well, &lt;/b&gt;with the wife celebrating her 23rd birthday on Friday.&amp;nbsp; Late Thursday night, I inflated 75 balloons while watching The Simpsons.&amp;nbsp; To my amazement, I didn't really become lightheaded.&amp;nbsp; But by the end of the third bag of balloons, I felt that my lips were burning fiercely, and it was then I remembered my allergy to latex.&amp;nbsp; Hmm.&amp;nbsp; Latex balloons might not mix well with me, then.&amp;nbsp; At least not 75 of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So I had a bit of a reaction.&amp;nbsp; I envisioned my poor wife waking up next to Lips Manliss on the morning of her birthday, with all me being able to say was a muffled "Mabby Burbfday".&amp;nbsp; Or something to that extent.&amp;nbsp; But the swelling went down and by Friday morning, I was back to my normal self again.&amp;nbsp; I cooked up my special breakfast of Sourdough French Toast w/ turkey sausage, but was completely disappointed in myself that I forgot to get the OJ.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After work that day, we went to a birthday favorite, Claim Jumper.&amp;nbsp; I swear those folks could cook a tennis shoe in motor oil and not only make it taste great, but present it to you in such a way as to make you believe it to be top sirloin.&amp;nbsp; I had the pepperoni pizza, the wife had the spinach salad.&amp;nbsp; We both shared a pretzel at the beginning, and the complimentary and obligatory massive slice of ice cream at the end.&amp;nbsp; Dinner done right, I tell you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Saturday brought an influx of friends to the casa, arriving one after the other to enjoy a night of Wii Sports, Excite Truck, DiRT, and Mario Kart.&amp;nbsp; When we all get together, the best thing seems to be the Wii Bowling, though playing that game mirrors the real thing all too well.&amp;nbsp; I play superb at the beginning, and end the night on a terrible note.&amp;nbsp; I'd say practice makes perfect, but I have better things to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So there you have it, life as I know it up to this point.&amp;nbsp; Who knows what tomorrow may bring.&amp;nbsp; I do know that we are most certainly leaving for Utah on the 28th.&amp;nbsp; Weather.com says the average high will be around 83 degrees.&amp;nbsp; I say Arizona will be hard to come home to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Blogginess</title>
    <content type='html'>Welcome to a new week of blogginess. &amp;nbsp;(I created a word, today hey hey)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like the site is in full swing now. &amp;nbsp;With a little bit of luck, I hope to have a little bit of business flow from this. &amp;nbsp;This weekend, Wife and I had more free time to ourselves than usual, so we hit the favorite spots. &amp;nbsp;Olive Garden, Hungry Howies, and of course, Best Buy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My wife is a dear. &amp;nbsp;And when I say a dear, I am trying to illustrate that she is the most thoughtful, kind, and loving person I know. &amp;nbsp;This short story must begin with the understanding that my cell phone was in dire straits. &amp;nbsp;Utter despair, I mean, for crying out loud, the last legs of cell-phone-ness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So on Saturday night, the last straw. &amp;nbsp;My charger broke while it was still in the cell phone. &amp;nbsp;Thing weren't really going smoothly for me that night anyway, I had tried using the barbeque outside of my apartment for the first time, and I couldn't figure out the blasted starting mechanism. &amp;nbsp;No matter, inside the house I went with the meat. &amp;nbsp;Wife suggested we use the George Foreman grill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once bite was enough for me. &amp;nbsp;It tasted like burnt ashes. &amp;nbsp;Oh, there were a few other happenings &amp;nbsp;that went totally awry, but we don't need to go into them. &amp;nbsp;Suffice it to say that the cell phone incident placed me firmly over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My wife decided, spur of the moment, to take me to Best Buy (my favorite store!) and get me a brand new cell phone. &amp;nbsp;This was the one that I had been craving for the longest time. &amp;nbsp;So here it is, and now, I share with you a picture of my cat, courtesy of my nifty camera phone.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>05/07/09 - No, I didn&amp;#39;t break my ankle...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-55 alignleft" title="photo-33" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/photo-33-150x150.jpg" alt="photo-33" width="150" height="150" /&gt;I don’t believe that I’m&lt;/strong&gt; a particularly accident-prone guy.  But I have to finally cede the fact that I have been to the hospital a fair share more times than the average 30 year old.  I found my way back to the ER this past Tuesday, when it felt like I snapped my foot off at the ankle during a night of basketball.  An unfortunate drive to the hoop and an awkward landing on someone’s foot was all I needed to ruin my evening (and more).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank goodness it was only a sprain.  Everyone who witnessed it was certain of a break, and I had little reason to dispute their observations.  I have never felt such intense pain in my life.  It was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; enough to make me give up the game.  Almost.  Not quite enough, though.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is that it’s only been a week since the injury and I’m walking again.  Very little limping going on, except in the morning.  The wife says I look like the Tin Man, with my unsightly shuffle-step.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I felt bad that I injured myself only a day before we left for Utah.  We tried to make the most of it, keeping our plans intact for the majority of the time.  I could do very little to help out; injuring the right foot meant that I couldn't even drive.  The best I could do was hold SaraJane when I was being carted around in a wheelchair.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;We saw plenty of family and a few friends.  There never seems to be enough time to see everyone.  I’m sure that if we ran around enough, we could have.  But then we’d have needed the “vacation from the vacation” that you hear about so often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A minor note about the drive home; &lt;/strong&gt;it seems that a bit more faith in Google Maps might be in order.  About 100 miles or so  before we reached the normal turnoff to the 20, we decided to try driving through Las Vegas.  I had never done it before, but had heard good things about it.  Every so often, I would double-check my route on the trusty iPhone, wanting to be sure that I had everything in order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each time, Google Maps tried to get me to get myself back to highway 89.  Even when I had passed Cedar City, it again tried to get me to rethink my strategy and pull back for the normal route.  My wife and I thought the program had gone bananas, and thusly ignored its suggestions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;I should have taken the hint when I finally passed through Las Vegas, and the iPhone informed me that I should hug the Arizona-California border and head home that way.  Seemed like an awful waste of time to me.  Oh, how wrong we were.  Never again will I pass that route.  Driving to Mesa from the 93/60 is the worst route imaginable.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a happy birthday &lt;/strong&gt;to my newest nephew, Parker Bowden.  Parker was born today, weighing in at 6 lb. 13 oz.  Welcome to the world, little buddy.  You’ve got yourself quite the family to enjoy the journey with.  &lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>It's 5:25am..what the heck</title>
    <content type='html'>So, we got into town here in Lehi, Utah at around 3:30am...but add another hour because of daylight savings time, and you have a much less inviting hour to start sleeping.  Plus, I had my very first &amp;quot;energy drink&amp;quot; tonight.  Since I had so much driving to do, I figured it&amp;#39;d be the right thing to do.&lt;p&gt;The can says 50% juice.  Ok, that&amp;#39;s believable, but I think the remaining 50% is deer urine.  The stuff tastes terrible, and it only gets worse as it gets warmer. &lt;p&gt;But that particular drink was a &amp;quot;Rockstar&amp;quot; beverage.  The first can I tried was a &amp;quot;Monster&amp;quot;, and that tasted like a bag of skittles blended in a can of grape Shasta with 14 sugar packets for good measure.  The thing was so sweet, it made my head spin.  I do believe we could have poured it into our gas tank and gone an extra 300 miles or so.&lt;p&gt;So, the point is that I guess I prefer the taste of orange deer urine, because I finished that can, but only managed about a fifth of the Monster.  Go figure.&lt;p&gt;I should try to get some sleep.  It&amp;#39;s gonna be a long day, and the rest of the family is sleeping soundly.  But how can I sleep when I have the remnants of the Soul Shaker 5000 coursing through my veins?  &lt;p&gt;Off I go to try!  Goodnight!  Or good morning.  Either way.</content>

    <title>Marital peer-pressure</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'm back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Interestingly enough, I'm listening to a lecture for a class that I just got home from.&amp;nbsp; No need to bore you with specifics.&amp;nbsp; However I find it interesting because I never thought I'd be listening to the class again after having sat there for two and a half hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I wish I had more interesting news to report; I really do.&amp;nbsp; I'm most happy that I am actually accomplishing something with the Web site.&amp;nbsp; I forgot how much I really enjoyed writing complete drivel on this site.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The rebuild of the site should also be done fairly soon.&amp;nbsp; I am completely removing all traces of the "professional" side of OTW.&amp;nbsp; It finally occurred to me, after many years of doing this, that I don't truly enjoy building Web sites for other people.&amp;nbsp; I don't find the same happiness when I complete anything else other than a new page for OTW.&amp;nbsp; Sure, I've done it; and I'd do it again for any friend that asks.&amp;nbsp; But the reality of it is that OTW deserves to be a simple site, one where navigation is a breeze and information (meaningless or not) comes naturally.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So tomorrow is my 27th birthday, which means...I'm turning 27.&amp;nbsp; I can remember as a smile child when older friends and family would tell me that birthdays just didn't mean that much as they got older.&amp;nbsp; I felt sad at that thought.&amp;nbsp; But it's all natural; it's just the way life is.&amp;nbsp; You turn your thoughts and energies to those who you care about most and that becomes your joy.&amp;nbsp; Now, that's not to say that I am not looking forward to tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; I have much to look forward to, such as a gathering of family and a present or two from my wife.&amp;nbsp; On top of that, my wonderful boss granted me the day off.&amp;nbsp; I don't believe I have ever worked on my birthday, and I don't intend to start.&amp;nbsp; Kind of keeps the magic alive, right?&amp;nbsp; I mean, I don't have a Hot Wheels racing track or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figure to open up tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I loved my Turtles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyone who happens upon this site might also wish to take a gander at &lt;a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bloggenpucky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Code Sanctuary.&amp;nbsp; There seems to be a general rebirth of blogging among my closest friends and family, and for that I am grateful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And speaking of which, my beautiful wife just sent me a message.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://jenna_gail.tripod.com/blob/"&gt;It appears that her Web site has been updated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Is there such a thing as peer pressure within a marriage? (see post from yesterday)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Love ya, Jenna.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Slip</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It finally happened.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I completely let the blog slip my mind last night. Grim. I figure that I'm allowed at least one miss, if not by works, then surely by grace. Yesterday was a terribly slow one at work, I think everyone must have left quietly during lunch, for when I came back from my own mid day snack, there wasn't much to behold upon arrival. I suppose I can blame the absence of several employees one of the four letter words in my vocabulary: Golf. Yup, I'm gonna go swing a stick atta ball and i figger I might not make it back today. Golf really isn't that bad, I guess. It's just not my forté. I tried it once and my eyes were so swollen from the grass or the pollen or the lack of real exercise that I just had to stop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today I went on a group date to the local rock climbing gym. I wish that I could have taken pictures, it's a really great looking place. Once upon a time, I climbed a lot. Now, 2 years later, I realize that I'm not so hot at it. By the end of the day I was so tired and my hands gave up. They're still putting up a fierce fight, must be why this entry is taking four-score months to type. I'm also pert exhausted, and I have almost complete lack of motor skills. Ho hum. There hasn't been any real concrete work done to the site so far this weekend, but perhaps tomorrow or next weekend. I wish to make it a more aesthetic experience for all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I hope everyone has an enjoyable rest of the weekend, back to the grind soon enough, eh?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Aye.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>I've been here before</title>
    <content type='html'>When I was a teenager, my dad and I visited this exact location after camping in Payson for the night.  Being a typical teen, I griped and groused the entire time, upsetting my dad quite a bit.  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think we ever made it down under the bridge, as I think I would have remembered such a scene.  I think I get it now.  They say that you get payback for all the things you do to your parents while growing up.  This is something I&amp;#39;d like to avoid, if possible.  &lt;p&gt;My dad&amp;#39;s probably snickering as he reads this, as long as he remembers my terrible attitude, that is.    My parents have been blessed with an uncanny ability to toss out those more trying times with me.  &lt;p&gt;But I think it&amp;#39;s time my dad and I came back for a little visit.  What do you say, pops?</content>

    <title>We're off to see the wizard</title>
    <content type='html'>Well, not really. See, the battery on my wife's &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;Macbook&lt;/span&gt; crapped out while we were in Lake Arrowhead. Yet again, we get to visit a "Mac Genius" to have the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;dern&lt;/span&gt; thing repaired. &lt;p&gt;This now makes for two DVD drives, one wrist rest assembly, one hard drive, AND &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; battery. I should mention that the one year warranty expired less than a month ago. I shall make my case, nonetheless. &lt;p&gt;I will admit that the folks working at (behind?) the Genius Bar have always been nothing but helpful and kind. But then again, that was when I was under warranty. They could spits fire at me now, as I didn't opt for their touted "&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;AppleCare&lt;/span&gt;" warranty. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;Sheesh&lt;/span&gt;. I hate extended warranties. &lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah, it's all been said before. Work calls, the break is over. Till later! &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;wirelessly&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bloody human nature...</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyJAEL8zhJjXkbVyt4hTlO-yCp1tmfuKDizRIcfLCELYtvJ8Ws8K2VWAHF8umUwnIQ38q0wpnesPEU0YkVm6yOD2bp_XlflXhPRXyEBmJteNZAcorCoy1ZcPyP8JeKylYqHX8m/s1600/simpbanner2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyJAEL8zhJjXkbVyt4hTlO-yCp1tmfuKDizRIcfLCELYtvJ8Ws8K2VWAHF8umUwnIQ38q0wpnesPEU0YkVm6yOD2bp_XlflXhPRXyEBmJteNZAcorCoy1ZcPyP8JeKylYqHX8m/s1600/simpbanner2.jpg" height="146" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The rest of the family is &lt;/b&gt;asleep at the moment, and that's quite an accomplishment.&amp;nbsp; We've had a terrible time getting Sumner to sleep over the past few days; in fact, I can hardly remember a time when he acted this crazy.&amp;nbsp; He was barking mad last night, I was afraid he'd lose his mind, hez was so tired.&amp;nbsp; Wife and I both made a special mental note to try extra hard today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Again, he's asleep now, for which I am grateful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For this week's entry, I wanted to report on how Sumner did in school.&amp;nbsp; Well, he did just fine.&amp;nbsp; Really great. In fact, I'm pretty sure he saved all his naughtiness for the weekend with his folks.&amp;nbsp; That's fine, better here in a controlled situation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We had an interesting day &lt;/b&gt;yesterday.&amp;nbsp; As the sun was setting and dusk was establishing its mighty grip on the streets around us, the nightly rounds of ATV rides begun.&amp;nbsp; These things are ghastly, noisy beasts, and I have been of the mindset to walk outside and ask them if they could knock it the frack off on more than one occasion.&amp;nbsp; But I've held my tongue.&amp;nbsp; Thank goodness I haven't entered the "get off my lawn" phase of my life.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully never.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Back and forth they rode, quiet Quiet QUIET loud Loud LOUD RaCkEt QUIET quiet gone.&amp;nbsp; Rinse, repeat.&amp;nbsp; My blood was beginning to boil, and that sensitive spot right above my eye?&amp;nbsp; Twitching.&amp;nbsp; Like the alarm clock on Peter Pan.&amp;nbsp; Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Eventually it became as background noise, and I was impervious to its effect.&amp;nbsp; Oh, it was still there, but I was one resigned man, sitting inside his resigned house with his resigned family.&amp;nbsp; This would go on for weeks, it seemed now.&amp;nbsp; At least until they lost their enthusiasm for the ATV.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
*SMACK* rumble rumble rumble&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I hardly made a move, but the wife darted up from the couch and said, "Did they just hit our house?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"No, they couldn't have", said I.&amp;nbsp; My house isn't on the corner of the street, and we're surrounded by at least 10 feet of rock on both sides.&amp;nbsp; We're safe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"I'm gonna go check it out", said the wife.&amp;nbsp; By this time, I was out the side door of the house.&amp;nbsp; My wife arrived through the garage at the same time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
She called it.&amp;nbsp; They ran straight into our house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's hard to recall what emotion I was feeling at this point.&amp;nbsp; Until this moment in my life, I had experienced some pretty bad stuff, car accidents, lost jobs, health issues, all with their accompanying emotions.&amp;nbsp; But this was different.&amp;nbsp; I was toying with the idea that it might be good to get mad.&amp;nbsp; So I did.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"I'm really sorry about your house", said my neighbor.&amp;nbsp; I mentioned something like sorry wasn't going to cut it, and immediately regretted it.&amp;nbsp; Because at that moment, I saw the driver of the ATV.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And then I saw his leg.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
His leg hit the house first, not the ATV.&amp;nbsp; Let me explain.&amp;nbsp; The force from the 40mph collision was absorbed by the single right leg of this gentleman.&amp;nbsp; The ATV came afterward.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
His lower leg was almost off.&amp;nbsp; What to do?&amp;nbsp; Wife went to get ice.&amp;nbsp; I went to get bandages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"I don't think it's broken", said the young man.&amp;nbsp; "If it were, I'd be crying, right?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Um, you just sit there.&amp;nbsp; I'll be right back."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As I ran up the stairs, I thought about my initial reaction to the scene.&amp;nbsp; Why had I gotten so mad?&amp;nbsp; It was just a house, which could easily be repaired.&amp;nbsp; This young man could have lost his leg or his life.&amp;nbsp; I didn't even think to look around for injuries.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I felt like a jackass, and I deserved it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I ran back outside and everyone was still there, and the leg looked much worse by now.&amp;nbsp; My neighbor proceeded to tell me to send him a bill for my house repairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I turned to him and pleaded with him to please forget the house for now.&amp;nbsp; I apologized for overreacting, and begged him to get his friend to a hospital.&amp;nbsp; He delayed further, which deepened my emotional despair.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Eventually, they got him back to the house, and the family and I walked back into ours, amazed at what just transpired.&amp;nbsp; I fiddled around for a few minutes, trying to rationalize my reaction within my own mind, when my wife decided to jump into the foray.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
She mentioned that I didn't see the poor kid at first, and that anyone would be upset when such a large chunk of their house was missing.&amp;nbsp; Fine, but I still feel bad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
She mentioned that I didn't raise my voice, and that I didn't sound mad.&amp;nbsp; Fine, but I remained steadfastly troubled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
With nothing else to do, I went back upstairs to my medicine cabinet and, remembering the traumatic experience when I shattered my own knee, retrieved a few of the remaining narcotics that I had left.&amp;nbsp; Not likely they'd accept them, but if anyone needed them at this time, it was this young man.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
You see, he was from Mexico, and most likely had no insurance.&amp;nbsp; I had no idea when they'd even get them to the hospital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I walked over to their house, knocked firmly but warmly on the door, and spoke to my neighbor again.&amp;nbsp; The first thing he said was that he already found someone to fix the side of my house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yep, there was that guilty pang again, right on queue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I shrugged his comments aside, asking him how his friend was, and offering the medicine at the same time.&amp;nbsp; He accepted it, and at the same time informed me that they were going to the Urgent Care as soon as they could.&amp;nbsp; I breathed a sigh of relief, apologized one last time for my reaction, and bid him good evening.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Later that evening, I was talking about the experience again with my wife.&amp;nbsp; She was her usual compassionate self, gently scratching my back and speaking her words of kindness.&amp;nbsp; She said that she knew one of the reasons why I took the medicine over there was to make sure the kid was alright.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But the truth is, I only wanted one more chance to apologize for the way I reacted.&amp;nbsp; The medicine, while convenient and needed, was merely a mechanism for delivery.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I think I learned my lesson this weekend&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>I must have a life less ordinary...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
I must have a life less ordinary...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What exactly do I mean when i say that? Simple...as i drove home and felt the 60 degree weather flow in through my car window, I briefly remembered the poor seldom-correct weather man saying "record highs, upper 70's for today." Oh well. And as the clouds crashed together and made rain, i thanked God that i had been entertained on the way home from work. Oh yes, and this is whilst i was listening to Pink Floyd. The DJ couldn't have picked a better song at that time. Quite synchronous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon returning to my house tonight i found spaghetti on the stove with my own sauce. MY OWN SAUCE. How many people in this world have their own blasted sauce when their mother cooks for them? I realized at this point that i am spoiled and the madness needs to stop. Oh, and i also downed a half stick of margarine on one slice of bread.&lt;br /&gt;
Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things should get better as time rolls along, but this will do for now. I must see where this goes...</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img height="266" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/89ef3440ed63f482777d3cbbc60f23e6/358318d9cefd4738-2f/s500x750/2deebc05073befa6d5bb521593998cd318fe4a37.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A few weeks ago, I posted a photo of myself perched atop a small cliff on a beach in Southern California.  I attributed a quote underneath this picture, which said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking out new landscapes, but in having new eyes" -Marcel Proust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today, when upon my morning readings I found this quote by Jack Kerouac.  Often venerated by swaths of individuals for his immense cultural influence and his ability to draw upon society's innate desire to break free from structure, I too have fallen more than once for these simple yet honest takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I took a moment to reflect and ponder upon this text, I paused upon each word in turn.  Especially the word "travel".  You see, dear readers...I am not yet a traveller.  I haven't embarked on any great journeys on God's green earth.  Have I been to a few places, seen a few beautiful scenes?  Absolutely.  Immediately, it comes to mind a time in my youth when I backpacked 10 miles into the Havasupai canyon. Never before (and never again since) had I seen such wonderful unified structure and chaos in nature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do possess with me an innate stubborn streak as deep as the canyon I visited then.  I also feel that to travel now would be folly...I am an addictive creature by nature.  And seeing how my means are, at this time, meager...I get the sense that it would become prohibitively expensive and an unforgiving vice.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I dig my heels into the dirt directly beneath me and stay firmly rooted in Arizona. &amp;nbsp;For what it's worth, I find great beauty and realize great satisfaction from the smallest of excursions within these borders. &amp;nbsp;But still, there is a great portion within me that winces with each passing year. &amp;nbsp;I both do and do not wish to travel. &amp;nbsp;It's a vexing place to be.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Riding a bike</title>
    <content type='html'>Riding a bike at night is an experience.  Especially if you explore like I did tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I was younger and living in Utah, I used to ride a lot at night.  Starting at the freeway, I would wind up the hills, careening around every side street and parking lot I could find.  There was something peaceful and relieving about the starkness of it all; there was not a person to be found and all was quiet.  I would end most of the rides in the canyon above the city, stopping to rest on a park bench before beginning the speedy decent down the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fast forward 15 years and it all feels brand new again.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've lived in my town now for nearly five years, and never got to know the streets like I have in the past week since getting my bike.  In a way, it makes me a little embarrassed.  Yet, there really isn't any other way to explore a city and it's plentiful alleys without stepping outside of your car and slowing down a bit. &amp;nbsp;With no one around, it's possible to stick your nose where otherwise impossible during the day. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Normal settings become locations of interest and value; gas stations, furniture stores, restaurants, cathedrals, and bus stops all shed their natural responsibilities and simply exist. &amp;nbsp;It's possible to see the city for what it is, almost what it wants to be. &amp;nbsp;During the day, a thousand people can cross another thousand people's path without notice or care. &amp;nbsp;At night, the opportunity is expanded yet minimized in the same stroke, as inhibitions kick in and you become wary and cognizant of everything around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In related news, I posted a picture from my travels this evening. &amp;nbsp;It's over at the Photo Project site, so make sure to wander on over.</content>

    <title>Lost/Found phone</title>
    <content type='html'>I had the unhappy circumstance of losing my phone today.  The silly thing was that I actually remembered where I left it, but found it missing from that location when I returned. (so, did I really lose it there? Good question  Anyway.)&lt;p&gt;I got &amp;#39;er back now, so I&amp;#39;m ready to roll.  I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit fuzzy after the weekend, mainly because it was non-stop for the duration.  &lt;p&gt;Man, it feels good to write again though.  Shows me that I need to keep it up.  I have a large blog coming tonight, too.  I did leave it alone for much of the weekend due to the fact that I burned myself up trying to learn Flash on Friday.&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s definitely time for an update.  Check that Blog page soon...you&amp;#39;ll be surprised, I promise you that.  I know I was!&lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

Suffocating my ability to garner rational thought. Rendering my soul into a compressed, fractional portion of what it should be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days. &amp;nbsp;A day when two decade's worth of retrospection yields few positive outcomes in learning from my own mistakes. &amp;nbsp;When the feedback of a dozen past leaders falls upon my back as the screeching of a legion of malcontents, hell-bent on seeking my endless misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My drive into work felt light as a feather; in fact, I remember thinking that exact fact. &amp;nbsp;How crazy it felt to have all the past weeks' stressors melt away. &amp;nbsp;They had all felt so intensely heavy not 24 hours previous. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was literally lost in the music I was listening to...Depeche Mode's "Memento Mori" album, fresh off the proverbial presses this very morning. &amp;nbsp;I felt hopeful, jaunty, energetic and full of a desire to replicate this sunny fervor that had captured my vision. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several hours later and I am defeated and flaccid. &amp;nbsp;Like I've spent the last week at the back of the refrigerator, forgotten by my benefactors and waiting for my expiration date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, this silly web site is still around after 23 years. &amp;nbsp;It's still here to capture and process my thoughts and moods and whatever analog photographs I choose to upload. &amp;nbsp;Simply having it around is like a warm blanket that softens the daily blows...a balm of healing to ease the friction of an endlessly anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Start slowly...</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hmm.&amp;nbsp; Well, &lt;/b&gt;I had to tinker with the site a little bit tonight, so I might as well throw a blog up for good measure.&amp;nbsp; Let me preface this by saying that the wife and child are out of town on holiday; therefore, nothing may be posted for another six months.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Or maybe not.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this wonderful impulsive post will give birth to a newfound desire to write and blog.&amp;nbsp; Anything can happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, what's happened in the months since August 8th?&amp;nbsp; Oh, much.&amp;nbsp; So much.&amp;nbsp; Wife and I bought our first house, in Mesa, no less.&amp;nbsp; I couldn't believe it either.&amp;nbsp; Somehow, we ended up at Higley and Southern on one beautiful Saturday morning.&amp;nbsp; Before you know it, I'm writing a earnest deposit check.&amp;nbsp; It was one of those A to B moments that doesn't quite make sense.&amp;nbsp; More like A to G.&amp;nbsp; Or A to Q.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yeah, that's more like it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So I really can't fill in the blanks.&amp;nbsp; A few weeks later, we moved in.&amp;nbsp; Simple as that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I have in front of me &lt;/b&gt;an unopened package of Sour Patch Kids, which I procured during the Christmas festivities.&amp;nbsp; I am battling the urge to break it open at this point, seeing how these things&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
A.&amp;nbsp; Rot your teeth, and &lt;br /&gt;
B.&amp;nbsp; Cause horrible mouth sores, the likes of which cause grown men (me) to cry.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, and I've already eaten two boxes this week.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that's why I shouldn't eat it.&amp;nbsp; Good.&amp;nbsp; It's settled then.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'll probably eat them tomorrow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It'll be a miracle if I can remember how to post this blog to the Web site, to tell you the truth.&amp;nbsp; Heaven knows I forgot my password months ago.&amp;nbsp; Well, if you're reading this, then congratulate me.&amp;nbsp; I did it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A few things I wish to mention:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
1.&amp;nbsp; The Nintendo Wii is the most awesome gaming system ever.&amp;nbsp; Ever.&lt;br /&gt;
2.&amp;nbsp; Excite Truck is probably the best arcade racer ever.&lt;br /&gt;
3.&amp;nbsp; The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess makes me cry, it's so blasted awesome.&lt;br /&gt;
4.&amp;nbsp; I'll still probably never get past the Water Temple in The Ocarina of Time.&lt;br /&gt;
5.&amp;nbsp; I'm seriously addicted to video games&lt;br /&gt;
6.&amp;nbsp; No really, it's a problem.&amp;nbsp; Needs to be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
7.&amp;nbsp; Why am I doing this?&lt;br /&gt;
8.&amp;nbsp; I'm tired.&lt;br /&gt;
9.&amp;nbsp; I scored a 215 in Wii Bowling, and I'm particularly proud of that.&lt;br /&gt;
10.&amp;nbsp; Everyone on the planet needs to get a Wii.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There.&amp;nbsp; That seems pretty good.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
You know what they say when you begin exercising (which I should also do), start slowly!&amp;nbsp; I'll stop this for now.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'll be back later this week?&amp;nbsp; A New Year's resolution perhaps?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Perhaps.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Ooh, it has a name...iDay</title>
    <content type='html'>Seriously, we are an anesthetized  nation.  Did you know the bald eagle was taken off the endangered species list yesterday?  &lt;p&gt;Take a look around you and see what else we distract ourselves with needlessly.   I won&amp;#39;t point the finger far from home though; I&amp;#39;m guilty too.&lt;p&gt;Too many cameras and not enough food.&lt;p&gt;Ah well.  Change should probably start with me.  Sorry for the downer of an entry...I just feel bad for the people who, instead of waiting for June 29th so that they could spend $600 on a new cell phone, waited outside an underfunded shelter last night because the beds were full.&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s a dramatic swing.  I&amp;#39;ll also  sound like a hypocrite at some point int the future, when I pine for the next latest gadget.&lt;p&gt;Hopefully i&amp;#39;ll be a bit more balanced out by then, eh?  &lt;p&gt;Hey, it&amp;#39;s friday!  &lt;p&gt;Posted.</content>

I only had that pup a few months before he got ran over by a car in my front yard. &amp;nbsp;After nursing him back to health, my parents decided it was best if I gave him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;And then the long dark winter set in, wherein no dogs came into my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;There were moments during my first marriage where I felt we were ready, but the kids were so young that we just didn't ever pull the trigger. &amp;nbsp;In hindsight, maybe the best time ever to have a dog is when the kids are young. But I digress. &amp;nbsp;Everything changed when, in 2017, we adopted a fabulous Goldendoodle. &amp;nbsp;His codename from the breeders was "Rocket" (all of the litter had Guardians of the Galaxy names), but we loved the name and kept it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Then the walls of life came crashing down; my marriage dissolved, and Rocket stayed with his mom. &amp;nbsp;I lived out of apartments and rentals and never had him around. &amp;nbsp;That sure made my 3 kiddos sad, but they were able to see Rocket weekly when they went back to stay with their mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Then, in 2019, I bought my own house. &amp;nbsp;Within weeks, I was hunting. &amp;nbsp;And I mean, feverishly searching. &amp;nbsp;I couldn't see myself with a large dog, and I knew I wanted a girl. &amp;nbsp;My niece had a really fetchingly smart Aussie, so I started playing around with the idea of a mixed Aussie. &amp;nbsp;Within a few weeks of closing on my house, I found someone in Gilbert who was selling the last of their litter...a 21 week Aussie-poo that was simply not wanted by anyone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I met her and that's all it took. &amp;nbsp;She rolled over on her back and I patted her belly and didn't even question whether I should or not. &amp;nbsp;I took the rest of my savings (there wasn't much) and bought her. &amp;nbsp;Within another day or so, the kids and I decided to call her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_%28character%29" target="_blank"&gt;Trillian&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;My logic at the time, being a single dad, was to have something to keep me grounded. Something to pull me back home when my kids weren't around. &amp;nbsp;Another living, breathing soul to fill the empty halls of my house with a fraction of the energy provided by my children. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;You must understand that if my kids weren't home, I would wander aimlessly after work. &amp;nbsp;Some of those nights were filled by meaningless dates with people I had met via online dating apps, spending way too much money for a dinner conversation that invariably went nowhere. &amp;nbsp;But most of the time, I would simply wander...driving aimlessly through the streets of the East Valley until I was hungry enough to eat alone at some restaurant and call it a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;It has been nearly four years now since Trillian entered my life, and while there have been plenty of frustrating moments, vet bills, messes, and early destruction, I am immensely grateful for her spirit. &amp;nbsp;The qualities of a dog are near endless, but her special ability to entangle herself in my emotions and help me sort them out is priceless. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;So, this is a small tribute to my dog, and maybe to all the dogs come into my life. &amp;nbsp;Each one of them laid a foundation of knowledge that percolated to the top of my mind when Trillian came into my family. &amp;nbsp;I hope I have trained her well. &amp;nbsp;And may she have many more years of keeping me company, and out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Pining for glow worms</title>
    <content type='html'>I can't believe it's been so long again. I do try, honestly, to write whenever possible but life seems to get carried away every so often. Full time jobs do not often allow for full creativity, especially in the&lt;br /&gt;
hot summer months when all you want to do after work is get as cool as you can as fast as you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I yearn for rain; but i do not see it yet on the horizon. So we wait in patient respect for the rain to come to our beleaguered state. I haven't even had the courage to visit the salt river yet this summer, i can only imagine that i wouldn't have much to see anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let's begin with the fourth, shall we? I still look forward to that day, i have ever since i was a young child. Sure, when i was a kid we were actually able to create our own pyrotechnic display...and i loved&lt;br /&gt;
when my dad would let me run out into the middle of the street to light off one of our many fountains or flowers or even a boring black "glow worm".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those were unique, it didn't matter if it was a regular worm, a glow worm, or a colored worm, it all looked like black soot and it smelled absolutely terrible from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really shouldn't try and redesign the site midway through writing. I have now completely lost my train of thought, if there ever really was one, i guess. You really ought to see the sunset outside right now...i just took a picture but it really didn't do it justice. That's one thing that Arizona has. Sunsets painted just like God intended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm out of things to write.....again. Take care.</content>

    <content type='html'>Somehow, I think you made the proper decision by NOT snapping that photo.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Oh, and what's the big deal about the cracked windshields?  I've had one for about 3 years (I swear).  One of these days I'll get around to fixing it.  Promise.</content>

    <title>Star Wars</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Best Movie Ever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Is it unfair that i say this a short 45 minutes after i have seen it?&amp;nbsp; Is it just pure emotion and the remains of the adrenaline that is making me say such things?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I sincerely doubt it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Like i said on my main page, George Lucas is the Master of cinema.&amp;nbsp; Now, i won't leave this entry to be a review of the movie, instead, i will leave that up to Eric.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to check his site soon to see &lt;br /&gt;
what his opinion is.&amp;nbsp; *hint* he gives it 9.9 stars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Other than movies and work, life moves on in the usual pattern of the seasons.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The temperature has well exceeded the 100 degree mark on multiple occasions, and i find it hard to believe that i &lt;br /&gt;
actually enjoy this weather.&amp;nbsp; Truth be told, i do love it.&amp;nbsp; You know what?&amp;nbsp; Sorry, this has to be a short entry tonight.&amp;nbsp; I'm just way too tired to think anymore.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
May the force be with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
(i couldn't resist)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>hey ryandavid.blogspot.com admin found your website via search engine but it was hard to find and I see you could have more visitors because there are not so many comments yet. I have found website which offer to dramatically increase traffic to your website http://xrumerservice.org they claim they managed to get close to 1000 visitors/day using their services you could also get lot more targeted traffic from search engines as you have now. I used their services and got significantly more visitors to my blog. Hope this helps :) They offer most cost effective &lt;a href="http://xrumerservice.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;backlinks service&lt;/a&gt;  Take care. Jason</content>

    <title>Sun City</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sun Friggin City...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The weekend is upon us again, and i am left to reflect upon the week's transpiring.&amp;nbsp; An item of the most prominent&amp;nbsp; note would be Thursday when i had an opportunity to ride along with a field tech at work.&amp;nbsp; The majority of the day was spent in Sun City, and it amazes me how you can ride down any one of those streets and feel like you have warped back in time to the 1970's...a decade when it was &lt;i&gt;cool &lt;/i&gt;to cement green colored rocks into your sidewalk...a decade when it was &lt;i&gt;modern &lt;/i&gt;to have a blue house, a decade when it was &lt;i&gt;normal &lt;/i&gt;when you spray painted your front yard in stark contrast to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;everything around you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;And it's been kept in pristine condition, like a child's prized comic book, so that you may see exactly what it was like for our parents.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes i wonder just who takes care of all the yards, who trims the trees just so they look exactly like the fruit they should bear.&amp;nbsp; I imagine little elf-folk groundskeepers with green hats running around at midnight, singing catchy little rhymes, like,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"We work so hard, yes we work so hard...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;so the old don't die, oh we work so hard,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;yes we try and try, and sometimes we cry!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;but we so work, so hard..." &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And so on, and so forth.&amp;nbsp; Ah, the unseen magic of Sun City!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Aside from the environment of that blissful city, it was a day well spent.&amp;nbsp; It was nice to see the other side of the telecommunications business.&amp;nbsp; By the way, you will probably never hear me say that i &lt;br /&gt;
work for the cable company.&amp;nbsp; It just doesn't suit me, and it downplays everything that my company is working towards...so from now on, it's telecommunications.&amp;nbsp; But anyway, i was able to see just how hard we work to make sure that somebody's TV is working properly, how much effort goes into ensuring that a customer has access to the fastest speeds possible for their internet, and how &lt;br /&gt;
little the installer's are appreciated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Blah.&amp;nbsp; So there you have it, today's blog.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy the weekend, and we'll see you back on Monday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Postscript:&amp;nbsp; Church Dance Tonight...*sigh*&amp;nbsp; I've been saying that since i was 12 years old.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Rain</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The rain came!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I woke up this morning and peered out my window at the clouds and hoped it was so. Sure enough, the rain was falling from the sky and cleaning the air. I breathed deep the aroma of fresh rain and sighed, this was all that i needed to start feeling better. The sickness is slowly but surely leaving the body. For those that don't live in Arizona or who haven't experienced the rain here, it's some of the sweetest smelling rain around. No salty fragrance from the ocean or lake, nothing but clean desert air. Chances are that it won't last too long, but while it's here i might as well enjoy it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I forgot to mention that it was Eric's birthday yesterday...happy birthday. 21 years old. So now i guess you don't have to feel bad anymore when they say on TV, "must be 21 or older to enter". Yes my 21 year old friend, disclaimers have no hold over you. Unless of course, you never really cared about that in the first place, in that case you can just ramble on with your life as usual. Yep.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nothing much else to report as of this moment. Good day, ya'll.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Airport thoughts</title>
    <content type='html'>My mind doesn’t just race at airports. &amp;nbsp;It chases every meandering thought down each terminal, back alley, and boutique shop. &amp;nbsp;Every consonant belonging to every cascading word in my mind takes up residence in the expressways of internal expression. &amp;nbsp;And tonight, it’s crushing me into the polished crushed granite tile paving the path toward my gate.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don’t know that I know how to grieve properly. &amp;nbsp;My brain has erected impenetrable walls and opaque veils between my emotions and my dialogue. &amp;nbsp;My fear is that one day soon, my inability to penetrate these fortifications will cause me to collapse in unexpected ways. &amp;nbsp;My hope is that no one is around when that happens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway. &amp;nbsp;I am at the airport. &amp;nbsp;These are my words about being at the airport. &amp;nbsp;And here’s a picture of the airport. &amp;nbsp;The end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJbQj6m4DXzOYUIlgUmyVD6A51WKyq_j8AzGyYeQSAomWc_qNSlERzenznpqvtGBonaWADqUANELa2yblpxpc3vmlEKmdWhU_adqru2V1vbcHWFrbodjakaOkGLoCEGNqPgRqcHjSzLuvCNdb7xoMO4t5U5ZZcm7t2bbkGDuPrtVqOBr8DGTqT/s3024/OriginalPhoto-737866034.253894.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="3024" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJbQj6m4DXzOYUIlgUmyVD6A51WKyq_j8AzGyYeQSAomWc_qNSlERzenznpqvtGBonaWADqUANELa2yblpxpc3vmlEKmdWhU_adqru2V1vbcHWFrbodjakaOkGLoCEGNqPgRqcHjSzLuvCNdb7xoMO4t5U5ZZcm7t2bbkGDuPrtVqOBr8DGTqT/w400-h400/OriginalPhoto-737866034.253894.jpeg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Greetings, and why I'm not married</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Greetings to you this fine day...&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's funny to think about life sometimes. I only say this because i'm waiting for the bad to come at any time now. I was able to get rid of my Honda and find a much more suitable car for my purposes, and i have what appears to be a dream job at a growing company. I'm happy, i have friends, the weather is still too hot, but that won't change till October. No rain. But nevertheless, life is cruising along at an incredible pace. In the words of Elder Nielson, life's so good, it's scary...&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This week has been spent mainly in the classroom at Cox. I won't delve into this too much since i may be divulging too much information, but know that it is both challenging and fun. I believe that i can stay a while at this company. This weekend, my friend Neal will be flying home from Idaho to spend a week in between semesters with his family. It'll be good to see him and spend some time with him before he leaves again for school. He is the last remnant of my friends that aren't married yet, a rare and highly (not) coveted rank on the Totem pole of life. No, really. I swear.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Why am i not married? Because i don't know. Why aren't you married? And don't give me anything like, "well, actually i am" because that doesn't cut it with me anymore. I need something more substantial to go on here, not just a reception invitation to pad your list of presents. Want to know how many receptions i've been to in my life? 3. My brother's, my ex girlfriend's, and my best friend Jake's. I may, and i can't confirm this, but it's a pretty safe bet, have a fear of commitment. Who knows, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Well, have a wonderful weekend. Catch you on the other side of Sunday...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Fourth of July, 2007 style</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good morning, and welcome &lt;/b&gt;to the Fourth of July, a day to be spent reflective upon the foundation of our country, those who sacrificed for it, and of course, to try and blow a small portion of it sky-high.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That is, unless you live in Arizona.&amp;nbsp; I don't believe we've had rainfall in months.&amp;nbsp; That leaves the state absolutely dried up, though that has no meaning on the yearly 'works.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of rainfall, most habitants here are patiently waiting for the annual monsoon storms.&amp;nbsp; I snapped this picture in late May, and had the false hope that we might begin receiving the storms two months early:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/IMG_0889.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIPnb27VKi1LPH5vg_c72dHzJsLsfKLj92xa-Lzfc21u8WIr3ki_JzN35l75bLxMLfEBltlfgon6jgyqEHvSPyo5hXckHI2fzSLepVujwC8ntL9ExTdplcH9zLvLPAhWG5JWGG/s1600/IMG_0889.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIPnb27VKi1LPH5vg_c72dHzJsLsfKLj92xa-Lzfc21u8WIr3ki_JzN35l75bLxMLfEBltlfgon6jgyqEHvSPyo5hXckHI2fzSLepVujwC8ntL9ExTdplcH9zLvLPAhWG5JWGG/s1600/IMG_0889.JPG" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yes, I know the picture would have been immensely better had those cell towers not been smack in the middle, but that's the way it is living in the city.&amp;nbsp; I was quite disappointed to find those towers so close to our little community of houses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I digress.&amp;nbsp; Ever since I moved to Arizona in 1990, all forms of fireworks have been illegal.&amp;nbsp; Oh, we'll see some tonight, brought to you by some large display by the city of Surprise, but you know it's never the same.&amp;nbsp; There's something about lighting that fuse and getting the heck out of dodge.&amp;nbsp; I take heart knowing that other states have not banned the art of colorful gunpowder just yet; it means that if we ever do move from this state someday, we may just be able to enact our own glorious display of pyrotechnic delight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As you may &lt;/b&gt;have noticed, I did manage to fix this page so that it behaves half-way normal.&amp;nbsp; The clickable calendar has been destroyed as it was too hard to manage.&amp;nbsp; Whenever I moved it, it would blow up the entire table, both where I moved to it, and where I moved it from.&amp;nbsp; Everything else is up to date, and the remaining structure will stay from here on out (or until I get bored again).&amp;nbsp; The only item that might change is the top graphic, as I have always felt the blog page needed its own flair.&amp;nbsp; Agreed?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There have also been further posts over at the &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if you haven't visited in a while, go check it out.&amp;nbsp; I'll always be grateful for the patronage.&amp;nbsp; I have noticed that the pictures I have taken with the mobile phone always lean heavily toward yellow; it makes me pine greatly for a better camera.&amp;nbsp; Not a new phone, mind you...I'd be happy with an auto-focusing 2 or 3 megapixel camera in my current phone.&amp;nbsp; But have I told you of the picture quality of the pictures from the iPhone?&amp;nbsp; Ah, the pictures I could take with that!&amp;nbsp; *back to reality* But that will not happen, as I couldn't do 75% of the other things necessary for the livelihood of the Moblah'g.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Eh, it is what it is, so for the immediate future, the mobile blog will have yellowish pictures.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;That's it for me &lt;/b&gt;today.&amp;nbsp; I think I've neglected my son for long enough this morning, and I haven't yet eaten breakfast.&amp;nbsp; But I've accomplished what I set out to do, and I can relax for the remainder of the day.&amp;nbsp; See you at the &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

So, it's been a while...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The past few days i have been sick. Now that i'm finally feeling a bit better, i'll catch up on the past couple of days. Thursday i didn't go to work, rather i stayed in bed all day and slept. Oh yes, it was worth it. Friday, there was an ice cream social (a huh min a who's a m'whatzit?) at the GCC institute building, so i mustered my strength and went to be social. Once there, i was invited to go see a movie with some of my friends at the local dollar theatre to see the movie Joe Somebody. And i love it, because even though it now costs $2.50, we still call it the "dollar theatre". But in reality, anything less than $8.00 after the hour of 5pm is a smokin' good deal. I guess it was a pretty good movie too, it was just way too long. It's one of those feel good type movies, right? But my rear hurt so bad from sitting for so long that i had a complete contradiction working for me. "Oh, what a touching movie! Oh, my butt hurts! " And so on, and so forth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Saturday was a good one. A group of my friends and I went ice skating. Mind you, i was still sick, and going to an ice rink probably wasn't the best place for me to be. But it was great. I hadn't done that in a long, long time. We decided to have a little race between four of us to see who could be the first to go around the rink 5 times. Whoops, great big monster mistake. Everything seems to be going fine, well, great, until one of those birthday-party-group 10 year olds decides to dart out in front of you, and then you smack into him at some insane speed , throw him to the side and hope to keep yourself in the race. Poor kid, i hope i didn't scare him. Hey, he'll be fine. Bruises (broken bones, cuts, lawsuits) build character. Lots and lots o' character.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So that's it. That leaves me with Sunday, and all i've done is go to church and avoid the Super Bowl as much as possible. I used to get excited around this time. Wait, but U2 is performing at half time, hope springs eternal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Postscript: I shaved my head. I feel like a new man.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>32</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;32&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My favorite number.&amp;nbsp; Karl Malone's jersey number.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The number of weeks that my wife is pregnant.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I keep disappearing&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I know.&amp;nbsp; Last weekend, I went camping with some buddies of mine.&amp;nbsp; I could tell immediately that this venture wouldn't be the most organized event, but that was A-OK with me, as I'm not much for planning.&amp;nbsp; But we did manage to procure the main necessities for the campout, such as food, water, warm clothes and sleeping bags.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We also obtained some firewood, as we were going to barbeque our steaks once we got there.&amp;nbsp; We were set, and we took off.&amp;nbsp; When we were about two thirds of the way there, my wife called to check on our status.&amp;nbsp; Seems we also forgot the wood.&amp;nbsp; Doh!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not a problem, my buddy says.&amp;nbsp; There's a gas station nearby the campsite where we can purchase some more wood.&amp;nbsp; After another 10 minutes, we park our car and go into this gas station.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As this station is in a very affluent area of Rio Verde, the place is spotless and the clientele is such that you would not suspect that much firewood is required.&amp;nbsp; The young girl behind the counter, who appears more apt to be found at a Saturday night rave party, mumbles that they have no firewood to speak of.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Harrumph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, off to Walgreens.&amp;nbsp; One more try.&amp;nbsp; Does Walgreens sell firewood?&amp;nbsp; I think we both know the answer to that question.&amp;nbsp; But they do sell duraflame logs!&amp;nbsp; Wonderful, waxy, crackly duraflame logs!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We bought them without so much as a second thought, and pursued our course onward to the campsite.&amp;nbsp; I had the terrible feeling afterward in my head that cooking over saw dust might be bad, but I was with my boys, and no sense acting like the crazy worried married guy.&amp;nbsp; Besides, I had already ruined my tough guy reputation with my ramblings about shopping at DSW and how much fun I had there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wait for the flame to go down&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We were a bit hungry.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, we were very impatient.&amp;nbsp; Shortly after the duraflames were lit, we plopped our steaks on the grill.&amp;nbsp; The fire rose steadily to the sky, charring every bit of meat that we had.&amp;nbsp; Lesson learned, and good thing too, because we still had five pounds of meat left.&amp;nbsp; Side note:&amp;nbsp; We also learned that A-1 sauce is the savior of burnt meat.&amp;nbsp; End of story.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Baby&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Like I said, 32 weeks along means eight weeks left.&amp;nbsp; Eight small weeks that pass like days.&amp;nbsp; Eight weeks means less than two months.&amp;nbsp; I won't calculate that in days, hours or minutes, as I would probably lose a great deal of apex hair in the process.&amp;nbsp; Time's doing its job well enough in that instance, I'm afraid.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Good night.&amp;nbsp; Time to fold up this parachute.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Greetings and happy Friday.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This weekend, I will be moving the site to a new host, so you may experience some problems when attempting to view it. This should all be taken care of by Sunday night, and i will email everyone the new address. What's to come? All of my previous writings will be published to the site, so that anyone who is curious may see them. Also, a great little piece of web genius called Difference of Opinion, which is the creation of my friend Eric and his friend Mike. So, be on the lookout for both of those.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Also to come: Curiosities of TV in the desert, Painting the house of Webb, and much more. Stay tuned, for sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Enjoy the weekend!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Yearning</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Last day of February.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This month seemed to fly by for me. And it's funny too, because when i was younger, February was the most painfully slow month that i knew, and the single reason for that is because my birthday is in March. So the days would drag by, until the 8th of March would FINALLY come and i would be a happy child. Well, not that i wasn't happy in the days preceding, but when the days last as long as weeks, well, there's only so much happiness that a 9 year old can achieve when he's waiting for a new Lego set or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Action figure...and of course my parents always got me exactly what i wanted. Who knows how much money they spent and how many hours they toiled walking up and down department store aisles looking for that darn-blasted Shredder with "action chop right arm". What a pain i was...my brothers and sister were right when they called me spoiled...well, that's what they get for moving out and leaving me to be the last one in the house.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, in roughly eight more days i will be 23 years old. I was talking to my sister yesterday and she said that i was old. I know 23 isn't old, in fact, i'm still relatively young, but when i was younger i thought 23 was ancient and that all people, upon reaching that golden age of 20, turned into giants and were whisked away into outer space to live on larger planets. Yes, i had an over-active imagination as a young boy, but that's why i had so much fun. So, now i'm almost 23, i don't look forward to my birthdays as much as i used to, and to draw testament to this fact, all i really want for my birthday is a new razor. What i wouldn't give to yearn for a new video game or something. Ah, my kingdom for a Lego set.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But really, this wasn't an entry to let you all know that my birthday is coming up...because really, everybody remembers it anyway, right? Also, thanks to the people that emailed me today about other jobs that are out there, i appreciate it and will look into them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
May your days be filled with happiness. Oh, and Legos...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Feel the waves come crashing</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The real ones will find me here. &amp;nbsp;If you're looking for me, you may have noticed that I announced something pretty surprising on Instagram about a week ago, only to turn around and remove everything this morning. I will not explain anything here at this blog...this precious repository of my most central thoughts and ideas for the past 26 years. &amp;nbsp;This is my safe space. &amp;nbsp;This will be my legacy. &amp;nbsp;This is where you will find me long after I am gone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I am so tired of having the rug pulled out from under me. &amp;nbsp;I am so tired of not feeling like myself. &amp;nbsp;I am so tired of anxiety and depression taking over my entire personality. &amp;nbsp;I want the pain to expire. &amp;nbsp;I want the world to shut up and start worrying about things that matter, rather than burn our mortality pestering people into fitting into ideologies that don't make sense. &amp;nbsp;I want all of humanity to love without fear, to lean on God in whatever manner that makes sense to them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;So, I return to Outside The World to again print my soul upon these digital pages. &amp;nbsp;If no one reads this, that's fine. &amp;nbsp;Maybe even preferable. &amp;nbsp;I've poured myself into reservoirs that hold no water; it's time to quietly copy my soul, bit by bit, into something that matters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;See you around.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Thoughts about iTunes 8.0</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Installation -&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Still takes way too long. I won't take the time to elaborate on the specs of my computer, suffice to say that it is well capable. Installation is taking well into the seven minute mark at the point of this post, and shows no sign of stopping soon.&amp;nbsp; iTunes is a notorious resource hog in Windows, and this installations bears the subtle markings of a kindred spirit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for that matter, about progress bars; why have them anymore? I cannot remember the last program that used one honestly.&amp;nbsp; This particular progress bar has emptied and filled a dozen or so times since I started installing, whether to tell me that it is computing space requirements, copying new files, removing old files, or *shudder* nothing at all; it's meaningless to the point of intolerable. Note to programmers, or Microsoft, if it is their doing: give me one progress bar that shows the entire wait progress. That'd be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start up -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Ooh! A new EULA. Five entire pages by the looks of it, including verbiage about something random and ill-named called "Kerbango Tuning Service". I won't read it; don't care enough to. Click Agree, move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it seems to have started up a tad faster than previous versions. I will remain cautiously optimistic about future beginnings. At this moment, iTunes is unusable to me due to the fact that it began creating artwork thumbnails, which undoubtedly is for the new browsing feature of the program. The program does seem to be taking an inordinate amount of my system resources now, as nothing else will really open up for the time. The program is also hijacking the focus of my desktop from time to time, a behavior I dislike severely.&amp;nbsp; Come to think of it, a behavior that occurs whenever syncing my iPhone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inteface -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Not bad. Not bad at all. I like the new grid view. I suspect I'll use this instead of coverflow from now on, which always labored unnecessarily on my machine. No other obvious cosmetic changes, which is fine. If I had my way, most of the changes would be under the hood, increasing performance ten-fold! But hah hah, I live in a naive world. There is still the subject of the new visualizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "Genius Sidebar" is present on the right side of the screen, beckoning me to try out the new service that creates smarter playlists based upon the music that I already have in my library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be honest and admit that I am curious to try out this new feature, as I have been looking to reintroduce myself to my own music again, not having listened to it in months. It's amazing to me how Apple repeatedly paves the way for music loves to enjoy their catalog even more. Off to try it out, impressions after I'm done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I am required to "opt-in" to the Genius sidebar, which stated will send information about my iTunes library to Apple. This particular disclaimer had to be read. Seems ok, so I press on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genius sidebar -&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Halted in my tracks, unfortunately. Well, not halted so much, but delayed significantly. Genius is now gathering information about my library, and by my rough calculations, will take about 10 full minutes to complete. What is so difficult about analyzing my collection of music, I wonder? And that, with much dismay, is only step one of three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three steps now concluded, I am prompted to select any track within my library to see related music within the Genius sidebar. I selected a few albums at first, such as Coldplay's newest "Viva la Vida", and David Gray's "White Ladder (my own personal favorite). My impressions? Underwhelmed at the moment. It's not really recommending any other music within my own library, only offering to complete various albums for money or suggesting I purchase tracks from the iTunes Music Store. That's all well and fine, and I may use that when I am a rich man and can afford music willy-nilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The new visualizer -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Worth the price of admission, which for me was a full hour of my time. It's beautiful, with spinning spheres and dancing ribbons of light. Every now and again the floating orbs wander about, rotating causally in random orbit. The best part? Unlike other visualizers, which only partially move to the sound of the music, these graphics actually react to each and every beat and grow larger as the sounds reach crescendo. I love it. Will certainly use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall, it's an iTunes&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;application that deserves it's 8.0 designation, because that's my rating out of 10.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Wash your car, you Prius owner...</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If the wife &lt;/b&gt;wants a blog, then I should write a blog.&amp;nbsp; I might add that she still calls them &lt;a href="http://jenna_gail.tripod.com/blob"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if I link to her Web site, she'll feel the pressure to update her own, which I might add has not been attended to in quite.some.time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I learned a few things this weekend.&amp;nbsp; The most random of which is this: Toyota Prius owners never wash their car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
If you doubt me, take a look at one the next time you're driving.&amp;nbsp; My guess is that it will have at least six months of residue caked onto each door.&amp;nbsp; The theory is that these environment conscious drivers take their passion many steps further.&amp;nbsp; Waste want, want not.&amp;nbsp; And they "want not" a clean car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We had a wonderful weekend, yes.&amp;nbsp; We spent our Saturday morning at the birthday party of a little girl whose mother works with me.&amp;nbsp; On the way there, we listened to the songs from Curious George.&amp;nbsp; It's a fine set of songs by Jack Johnson, although it gets a little too childish around the end of the album when he sings "Reduce Reuse Recycle."&amp;nbsp; Hey, he could be singing to Prius owners.&amp;nbsp; Never know with that guy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Saturday night we were off to South Chandler (who knew there was such a place?) where we attended a massive party thrown by my employer.&amp;nbsp; My wife has wanted to get pictures taken in those photo booths for quite some time.&amp;nbsp; You know the kind, they're always in the mall and they always cost $.25 more than you currently have in your pocket.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, those.&amp;nbsp; Well, turns out the company paid to have six of them at the party.&amp;nbsp; I lost all excuses to not enter into that forbidding closet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But once inside, I realized it wasn't all that bad.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what I expected, really.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps one of those chainsaw wielding maniacs like you see at the Haunted Houses around Halloween, I dunno.&amp;nbsp; I just held some deep seated fear of those.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh right.&amp;nbsp; It's because I tend to take lousy pictures.&amp;nbsp; Forget the chainsaw guy bit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nevertheless, it's amazing what an extremely attractive woman sitting by you can do when taking a picture.&amp;nbsp; Her beauty radiates so profoundly in all of the pictures that you must admit you hardly even notice me!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Hmm haw.&amp;nbsp; That must be it for now.&amp;nbsp; I'm fairly tired.&amp;nbsp; More to come this week.&amp;nbsp; Birthday on Wednesday!&amp;nbsp; Hoorah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>04/13/2009 - Fuzz</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;Today was a long day for some reason. &lt;/strong&gt; Not really something I can pinpoint at the moment, as the standout emotion I am feeling right now is a calming one.  I am fiddling around on my laptop while Sumner swims in our neighborhood pool.  Very satisfying.  I still have a lot to learn on Mac OS X, so much in fact that I really don't care that my computer isn't currently connected to the Internet.  I don't think I've felt that way since I was using Windows 3.1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So again, I'm just fiddling around while trying my hardest not to break anything super important.  Oh yes, and I'm also keeping a close eye on the lad, though I'm very impressed with his swimming skills.  He's trying to follow a much larger teenager around the pool right now while he swims laps.  I think this bothers the teenager.  So much annoys them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now he's attempting to make conversation with him.  I've counseled Sumner to keep to himself and mind his manners, and the teenager made no protest.  I'm going to assume that Sumner is, in fact, annoying him.  I think I'll let him be for now.  Pretty good entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier today, I had an orientation meeting &lt;/strong&gt;at the local hospital that I will be volunteering at.  I arrived at what I thought was late, but was surprised when I found myself the first in the lobby.  As each minute rolled by, more and more volunteers sauntered in the door.  There was a total of eight people in my very diverse group.  Living next to Leisure World, I expected a group comprised mostly of older people (or citizens, as the 34 year retired LAPD volunteer called them), but instead saw a complete range of individuals from all backgrounds.  Some, like me, had decided to pursue a different career and were hoping that serving at the hospital would give them further direction and light.  Others were graduated from their undergraduate program and wanted to learn specialties such as Social Work.  One older couple wanted nothing more than to share the joy they had found with their 3 1/2 year old Golden Retriever with others in the hospital.  One young woman was there to simply deliver cookies.  A great group of people that genuinely wanted nothing more than to serve their fellow man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I learned near the end of the orientation that we would already be receiving our ID badges, pictures and all.  My most previous experience with ID badges was not such a pleasant one, with a scowl on my face and grown out fuzz atop my balding head.  I began to regret not taking the extra time to shave my head that morning, when all of a sudden the power went out in the building and the reserve generator kicked in.  The volunteer coordinator gave us a sigh and admitted that there would be no ID badges today, as all non-essential devices would be powered down for the time being.  Small miracles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the hour grows late and the sun has set beyond the point of lighting my keyboard for efficient use.  There's always more to come from me, nevermind you that.  Thanks for listening to my tales this evening.  Till next time!</content>

    <title>Mr. Fix-it</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An evening with Mr. Fix-it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;And I kid you not.&amp;nbsp; Over the weekend, my Uncle George and Aunt Marla paid visit to the state of Arizona, and stayed at my parent's house for the duration.&amp;nbsp; We had a wonderful time of things on Sunday night, visiting until late in the evening and there wasn't hardly enough light to see each other's faces.&amp;nbsp; I looked forward to seeing them again the next day, as I wanted to show them my place and all the wonderful baby "things".&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Uncle George didn't take five steps in the apartment before he took to work on my broken laundry closet door, asking me whether I had any tools.&amp;nbsp; This was one of those moments when, as a guy, it's requisite that these items are available, and I feel rather sheepish when I explain that there aren't any handy.&amp;nbsp; No matter he says, and off he goes to work on this door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After a short visit to Home Depot, we decided that we had the essential tools and fixes for the hinge, and came back to finish the job.&amp;nbsp; By the way, this store still mystifies me, as I know I belong there, but I don't quite know why.&amp;nbsp; George seemed to know exactly where to go, but I remained lost.&amp;nbsp; He looked over an entire wall of gadgets, decided what we needed, and walked away.&amp;nbsp; I still sat there, puzzled and puzzling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'd imagine that I could do such fixes from time to time; however, my problem is that I don't know that such replacement parts exist.&amp;nbsp; I suppose that the lesson learned from this experience is that everything is fixable.&amp;nbsp; Everything.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The neatest part &lt;/b&gt;of the evening was when George and I went to OfficeMax to find a printer.&amp;nbsp; I didn't exactly know why, but then he told me that this was a surprise for the parents.&amp;nbsp; What a neat guy.&amp;nbsp; It takes a certain breed of human to understand and perceive what people really need and want.&amp;nbsp; We snuck back home and up the stairs to the computer room, where we deftly installed the printer and had my mom come upstairs to view some baby shower photos.&amp;nbsp; After a couple of quick glances at the pictures, George asked my mother which one she liked; after she pointed to one, he quickly printed it before she saw the printer in the corner.&amp;nbsp; She was surprised, and she loved it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;That's it for now.&amp;nbsp; Go back to your jobs, your schools, and your chores.&amp;nbsp; This page will be back again tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for dropping by!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Glo-fish</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;








&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I just got off the telephone with Sprint.&amp;nbsp; It seems that they managed to foul up my billing once again.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't that big of a deal, because I was certain that they had made the mistake.&amp;nbsp; But it was a whole lot of money, and Sprint is the one company that I choose (I don't know why) to have automatically debited from my checking account.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, the funds are gone until the next billing period.&amp;nbsp; (sound of toilet flushing)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sorry about that, I finally got fed up with the ominous odor emanating from my kitten's litter box.&amp;nbsp; I lost my train of though.&amp;nbsp; Wait, no, yes.&amp;nbsp; It's gone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And he just p00ped again.&amp;nbsp; Thanks, fat cat.&amp;nbsp; Gosh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In other news:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;So I &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3967179/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;found out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today that pet stores sell &lt;a href="http://www.glofish.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;glowing fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now.&amp;nbsp; Now, allow me to elucidate.&amp;nbsp; I found out that they sell, as pets, genetically altered (modified?) fluorescent zebra fish.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
These small goldfish look-alikes were originally developed to help scientists study pollution levels.&amp;nbsp; However, they are now being mass-marketed in the United States (sans California, which banned the sale of these creatures of science) as household pets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The news part of this is that two public interest groups have filed a lawsuit, alleging that these creations must be regulated by the feds.&amp;nbsp; They claim that these fish are unsafe and if released into the wild, could represent a hazard as other animals consume these fish.&amp;nbsp; We humans eat these other animals in turn.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So that's the basic of their argument.&amp;nbsp; Good case, I'd admit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
All I know is that I want one.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Brother's blog&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; If you haven't already, you ought to check out my brother's &lt;a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Web site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; There has been much controversy as of late with this &lt;a href="http://bloggenpucky.net/2004_01_01_bloggenpucky_archive.html#107411639261818973"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;particular article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, entitled Voluntary Simplicity.&amp;nbsp; If you'd met my brother before, you would understand me when I say that he leads a very simple yet complex lifestyle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
He is envied and misunderstood at the same time.&amp;nbsp; People turn to him for advice, yet dole out criticism in stride.&amp;nbsp; His comments on voluntary simplicity are genuine and intelligent, and darned if I agree.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
However, I lead a different lifestyle, albeit I admit that it's still strangely complex.&amp;nbsp; Take for instance my story about Sprint that I mentioned earlier.&amp;nbsp; I could be without that stress in my life, but I'd imagine that I'd bored with that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I think a fish hit on my wife&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; No, really.&amp;nbsp; We went to The Rainforest Cafe last Saturday.&amp;nbsp; We were seated adjacent quite a large aquarium with various tropical fish.&amp;nbsp; However, there was one fish that couldn't quite keep his eyes off my beautiful bride.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZtT_CB4-i3pTlyQA3_zsb-ViSq9MqCVcqEHkqusVIksFH23C9i8bbSDdVhHe38A4g3HogJOB4T3SJVsQ5f7RN8yTFATd451hwsB_NO39shzvyHvZ4Ygm37GASWUQirYm5TBnW/s1600/casanova.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZtT_CB4-i3pTlyQA3_zsb-ViSq9MqCVcqEHkqusVIksFH23C9i8bbSDdVhHe38A4g3HogJOB4T3SJVsQ5f7RN8yTFATd451hwsB_NO39shzvyHvZ4Ygm37GASWUQirYm5TBnW/s1600/casanova.jpg" height="227" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
He just sat there, staring&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
She thought it was creepy, I thought it was quite amusing.&amp;nbsp; And if you're wondering why I had a picture of this particular moment, stop wondering.&amp;nbsp; I take my camera everywhere now.&amp;nbsp; It's the greatest fuel that the Blog has ever had.&amp;nbsp; Ever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm sure there was more, but that'll do for now.&amp;nbsp; To make up for this week's missed entries, I'll be back tomorrow for one more.&amp;nbsp; But don't say I didn't warn you.&amp;nbsp; Go get me a Glofish.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>9/30/2008</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;30 days hath September.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;And&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;we are nearly done.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
Oh, the joys of driving to Utah overnight.&amp;nbsp; We'd done it before, of course, but I think we failed to realize A. the lateness of the hour and B. Daylight Savings Time.&amp;nbsp; Those two things combined against us to provide a very late (early?) arrival time of 5:00am.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
My dear brother Adam provided a much needed bed for us at that point, leaving us be as the four of us huddled together for a few hours of precious shut-eye.&amp;nbsp; It should be mentioned that the matron of the house kept eight small children at bay upstairs while we slept until 9:00am, surely no small task with the eldest only being 13 and the youngest a shade past six months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/monsoon/IMG_2872.JPG" style="color: #003366;"&gt;&lt;img align="right" border="2" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/monsoon/IMG_2872_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../pics/monsoon/IMG_2872.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Breakfast was gratefully gobbled up before a few hours of playtime.&amp;nbsp; The boy took full advantage of this time and booked it outside with the youngest of the lot.&amp;nbsp; They introduced him to the many offerings of the yard, including the hen house, wandering ducks and geese, and the garden.&amp;nbsp; It was at the garden where Sumner found most of his simple pleasures, convincing one of his cousins to let him pluck a ripe pepper from the tender vines, which he then stuck in his pocket for safe keeping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
The wife and I spent most of this time recuperating from the long journey while chatting it up with the eldest of the children and their wonderful mother, Diedre.&amp;nbsp; The wife especially appreciated this time, as she had plenty of questions for all of them, this being the very first time having visited them at their house.&amp;nbsp; After a few hours, it was back on the road for another drive, this time toward Lehi and my sister's house.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/monsoon/IMG_3035.JPG" style="color: #003366;"&gt;&lt;img align="left" border="2" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/monsoon/IMG_3035_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="../pics/monsoon/IMG_3035.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
The two girls were still in school when we arrived in Lehi, and being quite famished, we left immediately for some grub at Wendy's with my sister and her youngest, Noah.&amp;nbsp; I don't believe ever seeing my wife finish a meal quite so quickly before.&amp;nbsp; I won't pretend to be immune, I snarfed my sandwich in almost equal fervor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This blog was not finished for an unknown reason.&amp;nbsp; Go figure.&amp;nbsp; I'm posting it anyway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I was &lt;/b&gt;going to come back last night with a few more words about my adventure to the car dealership.&amp;nbsp; But now it's too late, and it's all out of my system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
No, it's not.&amp;nbsp; If it really were, then I wouldn't be in front of my computer, beating the keys.&amp;nbsp; Actually, I'm simply rambling.&amp;nbsp; I figure that one of these thoughts in my mind might take hold or spark another emotion.&amp;nbsp; But writing with emotion might give too much away at this point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Phooey.&amp;nbsp; I'm exhausted.&amp;nbsp; I'm writing tomorrow's entry right now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

    <title>Stop the car</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time in my car, if I'm honest. &amp;nbsp;I drive to work, children's schools, church, work errands, and personal stuff. &amp;nbsp;I love road trips, preferring them to flighty excursions across the country. &amp;nbsp;And while the majority of miles on my car are from my &lt;i&gt;54 mile round trip&lt;/i&gt; to work five days a week, I count numerous journeys to California, Utah, and local AZ hotspots amongst the nearly 67,000 miles on my 2019 car. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_M5YwJinWSVO2b3AIo3RmoR5mVWs9otgMkGqLD8QJSOeCg4pGRbfcxbv8AJdUWGR19486sbpUzTP3a9OZVRAV-wuCVxlzpavlWRxP_Avmf2wKkdqra1vZxhGD0LBUHMIRl_lPYNCydGsEqnxejdsDRXXWaRssfcB39SvdfINc63ob2pshrg=s3818" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="2863" data-original-width="3818" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_M5YwJinWSVO2b3AIo3RmoR5mVWs9otgMkGqLD8QJSOeCg4pGRbfcxbv8AJdUWGR19486sbpUzTP3a9OZVRAV-wuCVxlzpavlWRxP_Avmf2wKkdqra1vZxhGD0LBUHMIRl_lPYNCydGsEqnxejdsDRXXWaRssfcB39SvdfINc63ob2pshrg=s320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Outside of El Paso, TX...a monsoon squall crashes into the desert&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;But more to the point of this entry, I tend to see things. &amp;nbsp;"Golden Hour" is, more often than not, the exact time I find myself going to and from work each day. &amp;nbsp;The sun casts its shimmery flaxen light over fields of alfalfa near the reservation on Queen Creek. &amp;nbsp;It bounces off the rain soaked roofs across rows of suburban tract housing in Chandler. It passes through the leaves of an assortment of trees, both evergreen and deciduous. &amp;nbsp;The Superstition Mountains, with its numerous crags and peaks, gets an especially astonishing treatment in the evening hours, especially when clouds create stationary silhouettes across the red rock of the hills.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I see beauty. &amp;nbsp;I experience a visual embellishment in the world each day, but I am usually going 55+ MPH. &amp;nbsp;Rarely do I stop. &amp;nbsp;I feel a constant tug to keep moving toward the next appointment, class, destination, etc. &amp;nbsp;But each time I pass something by, I feel remiss. &amp;nbsp;And I do understand the notion of living in the moment, thereby granting mindfulness and gratitude for the immediacy of life. &amp;nbsp;But I nevertheless have a longstanding and &lt;i&gt;conflicting&lt;/i&gt; love of photography that simply demands that moments of beauty be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preserved, and if I am honest, shared for others to see. &amp;nbsp;I think I have a little bit to contribute to this crazy world. &amp;nbsp;To that end, I've made a promise to myself to stop my car just a little more often. &amp;nbsp;It's a matter of slowing down a tiny bit. &amp;nbsp;I took a look in the mirror today and saw an abundance of gray staring back at me. &amp;nbsp;It seem that, in a momentary blink, two decades have rushed past me, leaving little imprint to immediate recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that one way to slow time is to constantly learn. &amp;nbsp;It feels immensely rewarding to be learning and creating again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Sweet deal</title>
    <content type='html'>My goodness. &amp;nbsp;Where have I been?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's a long story. &amp;nbsp;It all started back at the end of the week of the 19th, when I began a new Beta project. &amp;nbsp;I found it necessary to format my computer, and in so doing, completely eradicated all of my Office software (including FrontPage).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bummer. &amp;nbsp;So no worries, I simply had to reinstall my Office suite and move on, right? &amp;nbsp;Sadly, no. &amp;nbsp;Upon reinstallation, I found out, to my dismay, that the software had recently expired. &amp;nbsp;So, that brought an abrupt end to the blog and all other updates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wish that I could say that I had decided to take a break from writing, or that my Web site updates needed a hiatus for creative recovery. &amp;nbsp;Neither for the former...but we're finally back in business after the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which, by the way, mine was wonderful. &amp;nbsp;Granted that New Years has not yet happened; however, I feel so estranged from that particular holiday that it really has no specific meaning for me. &amp;nbsp;Although, the resolutions this year should be predominantly meaty. &amp;nbsp;First, there's the not-so-small matter of rehabilitating my knee. &amp;nbsp;I continue to forget that I forked over a lot of cash so that I could play basketball again, and somehow, other things are taking front seat to that effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, there's that tiny event on the horizon. &amp;nbsp;I must prepare myself, both physically and mentally, for the birth of my son. &amp;nbsp;I just had to pause at that statement for a good 45 seconds. &amp;nbsp;I hadn't yet thought of it quite that way...my son. &amp;nbsp;It's not an unsettling feeling, really...more so, it's a startling realization that it's not just a game. &amp;nbsp;Please, don't get me wrong, I hadn't thought of fathering a child as a source of entertainment. &amp;nbsp;The mere thought hadn't crossed my mind. &amp;nbsp;But, sometimes parents get caught up in the romance of any given idea, especially child-birth, and more especially, the birth of their first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one has really provided us with the stern warnings that I thought came with this territory. &amp;nbsp;When Wife and I decided to wed, there were the usual talks and speeches about how it's not all fun and games, about how it's hard work and there will be tough times for any couple. &amp;nbsp;We understood that, and expected it (it hasn't yet happened, mind you...six months)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But doesn't anyone have any horror stories about children for me? &amp;nbsp;I've heard the poopie diaper dramas and the screaming-child-at-3:00am stories, but those are simply expected. &amp;nbsp;It's programmed in the parents hard-coding. &amp;nbsp;I want some real advice: I want some sit up straight and listen, dangit, because you've had it soft and you ain't got no idea what's in store kind of advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or, maybe I don't. &amp;nbsp;Maybe that was a horrific tangent that I just delved into. &amp;nbsp;Spare me, for I think I may be going a little crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where was I. &amp;nbsp;Oh yes, New Years resolutions. &amp;nbsp;Yes, there's the customary "work out, eat better" resolution, too. &amp;nbsp;I'm anticipating a little assistance from my spouse on that one, though. &amp;nbsp;I've never made it more than three months into the year without pooping out in one form or another. &amp;nbsp;Although I think that I had a fairly good excuse last year, what with the engagement and wedding and surgery and all...but this year, no excuses. &amp;nbsp;Nothing, short of child-birth, will stop me from reaching my goal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, boy, am I in for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, to elucidate further on Christmas day, it was a great one. &amp;nbsp;Dare I say it, it was the best one ever. &amp;nbsp;I got everything I could have wanted and then some. &amp;nbsp;Plus, I was able to make my wife happy with most of what she wanted. &amp;nbsp;I still think there may be something that I forgot along the line, but no matter. &amp;nbsp;We're both happy. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most notable, I received the digital camera that I so dearly wanted. &amp;nbsp;The biggest surprise came from my wife. &amp;nbsp;She managed to find the music-creation software that I wanted. &amp;nbsp;As a result of these gifts, additions will be in place in the Media page of my Web site. &amp;nbsp;Sweet deal. &amp;nbsp;You know what? &amp;nbsp;That deserves a graphic:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF58a7G_TCAG_CQV31hAD-3RKb8xxDXosR-d201BiNcyoczoG7FWwN18JpyPJIs-JrGiC9r4hYkdLBvAaysosSY6nopvjNqcXk45xcjwmjEd3rK2YMseDq6Bn9w-w90bOV0ovc/s1600/BACK.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF58a7G_TCAG_CQV31hAD-3RKb8xxDXosR-d201BiNcyoczoG7FWwN18JpyPJIs-JrGiC9r4hYkdLBvAaysosSY6nopvjNqcXk45xcjwmjEd3rK2YMseDq6Bn9w-w90bOV0ovc/s1600/BACK.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yes. &amp;nbsp;See you tomorrow! &amp;nbsp;So much more to come! &amp;nbsp;Thanks for coming back. I'll be sure and make it worth your time.</content>

    <title>Relaxation techniques</title>
    <content type='html'>Just go get a massage.  From a professional, mind you...not some random joe.  I found a combination oil change/massage clinic down in Mesa a few months ago.   What the heck is that?  &lt;p&gt;Seriously, upon further thought, I don&amp;#39;t want to know why they combined the two.   *shudder*&lt;p&gt;The wife and I are out getting a massage at this time, in celebration of the four year anniversary.  I know, a little late, but it&amp;#39;s the thought that counts.  I&amp;#39;m waiting patiently, hence the blog update.&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that this might read a bit disjointed, so I&amp;#39;m going to end for now.  Good day!&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>I Ran</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Moving.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Remember that impending move that I wrote about two weeks ago?&amp;nbsp; It now appears as if that day is just around the corner.&amp;nbsp; Are we ready?&amp;nbsp; No, but we have an excess of boxes strewn about the apartment.&amp;nbsp; Do we have a truck?&amp;nbsp; Well, yes and no.&amp;nbsp; Let's lean more toward the yes answer for the time being.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's tough to summarize when you've been away for so long.&amp;nbsp; At first, I really believed that I would sit down and compose some scrab for the Blog last Saturday, but that never quite came to fruition.&amp;nbsp; Regretfully, I didn't even bother to write when my beautiful wife implored me to get back on the computer.&amp;nbsp; For that, I apologize.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E-mail writing&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Earlier today, I took part one of a two part e-mail writing class for work, so I have so many alternate and conflicting rules in my head at this time.&amp;nbsp; My writing feels somewhat labored because of this.&amp;nbsp; It feels like I'm trying to carve a dull butter knife through ice.&amp;nbsp; I know it'll work, but it slips a lot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I can hardly wait to see what two days of this class will do to my writings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Flock of Seagulls&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Why, what a strange looking header for a paragraph?!&amp;nbsp; For those of you who don't watch VH1, they have recently been touting a new show called "Bands Reunited".&amp;nbsp; I never intended to sit down and watch it, really.&amp;nbsp; But I came home an hour early from work today and hadn't much else to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
To boil it down to the basics, the host of the show runs all around central England, looking for the disbanded members of A Flock of Seagulls.&amp;nbsp; The four band mates haven't talked in 20 years, there could be bad blood, one hasn't played the guitar in eight years, and so on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But it was fun to watch.&amp;nbsp; I know only two of their songs, but I could tell that they were having fun again.&amp;nbsp; Whether that was made up for the show or it was true reality, doesn't matter.&amp;nbsp; I got to hear them play "I Ran" again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Let's keep it brief.&amp;nbsp; And I will be back later.&amp;nbsp; Anyone want to help me move?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Perfect Blue November Sky</title>

Finding something to shoot, well...that was a touch the opposite way. &lt;p&gt;Having lived in the same place for five years, I tend to stick to the same path when I leave the house. I know the houses, the people, it&amp;#39;s all very familiar and comfortable to me. That&amp;#39;s why I smiled when I elevated my gaze for just a moment and saw these two palms reaching toward a perfect blue November sky. Hadn&amp;#39;t noticed them before, yet there they were. &lt;p&gt;Lens: John S&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1969</content>

My youngest child has always represented sunshine to me. She still exudes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fasting&lt;/b&gt;...something many in my faith do once per month. &amp;nbsp;I did yesterday, and it all fell apart. &amp;nbsp;Normally, hunger doesn't exacerbate my mood too much. But add in the headache that appeared late morning, and I was set up for failure for the rest of the day. &amp;nbsp;Any small or large stressor that appeared caused me to emotionally tailspin each time, thereby throwing the brunt of the fallout on my poor wife's shoulders. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to make it up to her, somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&amp;lt;thump&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I have a headache.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&amp;lt;/thump&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's all I have to say. When I awoke this morning, it was there, coasting along the crest of my neck, ready to pop upward into my skull. Around 9:30, this brain ache was in full effect, not relinquishing it's kung-foo grip on my poor noggin. Surely I'll hear about my performance at work (or lack thereof) tomorrow, because I simply couldn't convince my fingers to strike the keys for some reason. Why was that again? Oh yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&amp;lt;thump&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
THAT.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&amp;lt;/thump&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not much else is new in the world o' Burninghams, the apartment complex assured me that someone would be by during my lunch hour to remedy my air conditioning situation. Alas, no one arrived. I get home from work, and see a note on my front door. It said: (my comments in &lt;span class="s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Dear resident 1137: (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;How touching!&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Came to cook at alc not home no ple will ret. (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;really?&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The Apartment Complex&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Maintenance Technician&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, OK. Then you did come to cook, something about alc, that's fine. I'll see you soon, I suppose.....&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Moods, moods.</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I guess I'm in one of those moods again today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I watch blessed little television as of late (due to the proliferation of the internet or the lack of quality programming, i know not which). So i was extremely put-off when i switched on the tube today to find out that the Simpsons was 7/8 of the way done. A little consistency is all i ask, just a little blasted consistency. Why start it at 6:30? It always begins at 7:00. So i was forced to channel surf, and i thought that i had found a suitable substitute for my evening with Larry Kings' interview of the stars of The Lord of the Rings...but when Sir Ian Mckellan described the joy he found in coming out of the closet and how it made the world a better place, for the world or for him i don't really know....i got severely disinterested and had to switch it off. Oh, well, lets move on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What's on tap for the coming week? Promised pictures, for one. Maybe even a biography of one of my friends...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
God bless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Novarg?</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Novarg.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;True story.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Monday, January 26th, 6:45pm.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Hmm, what's this?&amp;nbsp; A strange attachment from someone that I don't know?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
"Yes", said my conscience. "Be careful."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"I'd better scan it for viruses, just to be safe."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
"Um, ok.&amp;nbsp; Or you could delete it"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"No, it could be important.&amp;nbsp; I'll just scan it really quick."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
"Please don't be stupid."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;McAfee VirusScan - E-mail scan completed successfully. No virus found!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Well, not a virus in sight.&amp;nbsp; I guess I'll...just...open...it...After all, it's only a text file, right?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
"I'm outta here."&amp;nbsp; And there went my better judgement.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Strange...nothing but garbage binary.&amp;nbsp; I'll just delete it."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CANNOT DELETE.&amp;nbsp; FILE IN USE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
"No it's not in use!&amp;nbsp; It's a stupid text file.&amp;nbsp; Delete!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CANNOT DELETE.&amp;nbsp; FILE IN USE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&amp;lt;Banging head against keyboard&amp;gt; "NO, it's not.&amp;nbsp; Delete!&amp;nbsp; Garbage can!&amp;nbsp; Gone! &amp;lt;/Banging head against keyboard&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CANNOT DELETE. FILE IN USE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Fine"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
FORMATFORMATFORMATFORMATFORMATFORMATFORMATFORMATFORMAT&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p5"&gt;
And the moral to my story is:&amp;nbsp; There is none.&amp;nbsp; As there is no. excuse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

It&amp;#39;s also moved indoors, though  &lt;br&gt;that&amp;#39;s understandable with the climate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sumner really doesn&amp;#39;t believe me that I used to live here when I was  &lt;br&gt;his age.

Many regrets I have already laid to rest, happily exercising my rights to introspectively assign value to actions vs their outcomes. &amp;nbsp;There have certainly been a great share of youthful fantasies that never bore fruit. &amp;nbsp;I have identified and cataloged many instances of arrogance and suppositional rhetoric in my years. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I can't look back at what might have been, because I did what I did at times for a colorful tapestry of reasons. &amp;nbsp;At some moments, survival was paramount. And still others, I was interested in the thrill of change, of spontaneity that would surely drive the winds behind the sails of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I suppose that, given a bit of temperance, I can entertain the thought that life still holds much in front of me. &amp;nbsp;Mid life (in all it's sundry machinations, pock-marked with exhaustion, financial insolvency and straight-up dehydration) has me by the scruff of my neck right now, and it's hard to see above the trenches at times. &amp;nbsp;I am paralyzed with fear at forever screwing up more lives around me than I have hairs on my speckled head. &amp;nbsp;I often press the pause button and wonder, in the words of David Byrne, "Well, how did I get here?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Yes, yes...the days go by. &amp;nbsp;Racing, forever racing because no matter how hard I try, I cannot exist for learning, and to slow down time is a fruitless exercise of sentimental futility. &amp;nbsp;Dry and brittle are the new hobbies that sink their atrophied claws into my soul; I continually reach backward to draw old pleasures into the present-tense of my life. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps that, my friends, is why my right shoulder has seemingly drawn its last ping-pong ball from the tumbler of life's lottery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I carry with me so much passion, so much hubris. &amp;nbsp;I sometimes explode with such unannounced and unfocused tremors of anxiety that I cannot help but wonder where it all comes from. &amp;nbsp; I was told all along that I ought to break the cycle of generational trauma, but which character traits do I carry in my psyche that, if lopped off with reckless abandon, would sever ties with lesser-developed but internal sensitivies in my soul? &amp;nbsp;Who knows. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Anyway, here's a picture of the Sonoran desert that I took while I was punishing my body during a 41 mile bike ride this past Saturday morning. &amp;nbsp;As for the rest of the words in this entry, I have no idea where they came from, or why the savory picture of a morning's sunrise caused them to protrude with such fervor from my nervous soul. &amp;nbsp;Enjoy this fine Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>One week a dad</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Oh no!&amp;nbsp; Taxes are due.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wait, they're all done.&amp;nbsp; Good deal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nothing gets you in the mood quite like perusing the blogosphere.&amp;nbsp; I know of quite a few crazy blogs out there, some of which I have listed below in no particular order.&amp;nbsp; It's not a matter of, "If they can write, I can write."&amp;nbsp; It's simply the fact that I believe it's an honor to read a part of these people's lives, and the only way that I know to repay is to return blog-blather in kind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sumner's birthday&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Ok, not really.&amp;nbsp; But he is one week old today, and it flew by.&amp;nbsp; If this is how the rest of his life is going to be, then I would be well-off if I paid as much attention as possible.&amp;nbsp; He's manages to move his little head around quite a bit.&amp;nbsp; When he hears my voice, he lifts his noggin off of his mother's chest and peeks around a little bit, then drops his head back down in exhaustion.&amp;nbsp; What a kid.&amp;nbsp; He'll be mobile before I know it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I felt like&lt;/b&gt; a couch potato today.&amp;nbsp; After watching "Pimp My Ride" on MTV and playing every single level on Super Mario Brothers II, I think it's safe to say that I've had enough television for a while.&amp;nbsp; But I'm trying to get things in while the boy is asleep, that's all.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and my wife made the most delicious entree in the world again today.&amp;nbsp; Chicken and Sour Cream enchiladas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Wait.&amp;nbsp; Telephone's ringing.&amp;nbsp; In the baby's room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Ok, I've returned, and the baby is fully awake now.&amp;nbsp; So as to allow my wife a little extra sleepy time, I've taken the little one and am attempting to finish off tonight's entry with him in tow.&amp;nbsp; It's no small feat to type with two hands while balancing a one-week old on your chest.&amp;nbsp; I can barely see the monitor.&amp;nbsp; This is also a fairly comical sight, as he is pecking gently at my shirt to see if he can get something to eat.&amp;nbsp; Sorry little one, nothing for you there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Alright, I had more to write, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I'll have to cut this short.&amp;nbsp; Bigger things to attend to at the moment.&amp;nbsp; More later!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>04/16/09 - Something to write</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;Something about having a notebook&lt;/strong&gt; with me where ever I go encourages me to write.  Although I still wish I were a pen and paper guy; my brother keeps a journal with him wherever he goes so he can jot down ideas and thoughts immediately.  I guess it shows the 10 year disparity between us.  I do remember the thrill of the open, blank page too, but my tenure with such an environment was shorter lived and thus my transition to typing everything was much more rapid.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even in the dawn of the digital revolution, writing on word processors was more engaging than most contemporary computer programs.  All you had was the cursor and maybe a menu.  Nothing to distract you; nothing to lead your writing down the wrong angle.  It's what I dislike most about Microsoft Word.  They seem to think you want 9,000 options when really, all you want to do is make something bold, or change your font.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Writing with the pen is an art.  I should put more energy into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spent most of the &lt;/strong&gt;morning cleaning up the house with the family's help.  Too much was neglected yesterday; Wednesdays are generally nasty.  The wife is at work all day.  Waffles came to the rescue though.  Waffles make everything better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We did manage to get Sumner's hair cut though.  When the time came for Sumner to jump in the chair, the young lady called out "Summer", as happens more often than not.  The wife and I both knew this was a possibility when we named him, but I didn't realize how annoying it would be.  This, coming from the person who was called "Ryan" or "David" or some other combination his whole life, but never "RyanDavid".  SaraJane won't fare much better, I'm afraid, even with the lack of a space betwixt her pronouns.  What have I done?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's much for us to look forward to &lt;/strong&gt;in the coming weeks, as we get to travel to Utah as a family to see my niece's baptism in early May.  I haven't been in Utah in spring time in years, so it will be nice to go back.  I called Snowbird today to make reservations like I do every year, but received word that Summer packages won't go into affect until a week after we leave.  Sigh.  There's always next year!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No word yet&lt;/strong&gt; on when the volunteer work at the hospital begins; I was hoping for a call this week.  With Friday on the horizon, I'm leaning heavily toward next week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The boy just came upstairs;&lt;/strong&gt; he seems a bit restless.  I'm going to do the daddy thing for a little while.  Thanks again for reading!</content>

The wife and I hadn&amp;#39;t been here in nearly eight years, so the idea to divert from the original destination seemed well justified. &lt;p&gt;After a quick FaceTime call to my brother, the wife and I shot the beach like it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be there the next day. A few more shots will be posted in the coming moments. &lt;p&gt;Lens: John S&lt;br&gt;Film: BlacKeys B+W</content>

    <title>A poem, at last</title>
    <content type='html'>I find that distractions are at times avoided&lt;br&gt;By diving deep into their static maw&lt;br&gt;Focusing on a single point &lt;br&gt;And drinking from the cup of time&lt;p&gt;Dance; dream and reduce your sleepy eyes&lt;br&gt;To a vapor-like ember of a memory&lt;br&gt;Coalesce all that you know into your burning cells&lt;br&gt;And grant honor to years. &lt;p&gt;Lines down glass is all that I know&lt;br&gt;Best described by noise, humor and filler&lt;br&gt;And the world could be still, could be still...&lt;br&gt;But by choice, I amble full-bore down the path.  &lt;p&gt;Tap, glance and blow; repeat&lt;br&gt;Find the pattern in my synapses&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s there, all there, surrounded by light and dark&lt;br&gt;Amazed by resiliency, posted to my constitution. &lt;p&gt;Words, yes. All words&lt;br&gt;But an ending to a diluted prematurity&lt;br&gt;Patterns in the fabric of stylized grammar&lt;br&gt;Fool hearty and stout all the same for lack of time</content>

    <title>What is an imp</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Did you know&lt;/b&gt; that stucco can be removed solely by using hot water and a scraper?&amp;nbsp; I didn't know that.&amp;nbsp; And while I'm mentioning things that I don't know, let me add that I don't know why anyone would stucco the entire inside of their house.&amp;nbsp; That just bamboozles my mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Let me clarify by saying that no one that I know personally has stuccoed their house.&amp;nbsp; However, in a quest to help my dear mother-in-law with removing a bit of stucco from her fireplace, I ran across many stories on the Web of people attempting to remove stucco from the entirety of their home.&amp;nbsp; *shudder*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New Blog Link&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You may want to check it out.&amp;nbsp; It was introduced to me through my brother and fellow blogger, Adam.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The site itself is called &lt;a href="http://lostcoyote.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lost Coyote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In other news&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Life just keeps rolling along, giving no heed to the weary or forgetful.&amp;nbsp; Like I said yesterday, it's extremely hard to summarize entire missed days in one entry.&amp;nbsp; I find the pace of life marvelous.&amp;nbsp; I sometimes have so many goals that I miss the mark on a few.&amp;nbsp; By and large, the goals get accomplished or they get set aside, but never cast off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sometimes I have to remember where I've been by looking at my bank statement.&amp;nbsp; I'm so much more busy now that I have a wife and an apartment and a car and a crazy cat.&amp;nbsp; Bear with me as I have a child.&amp;nbsp; I might just feel so sorry for myself that I'll realize how easy I had it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'll quit yacking, back on track now.&amp;nbsp; Above, you'll see my new graphic.&amp;nbsp; Whenever I open Photoshop, I end up creating something new.&amp;nbsp; I find a unique solace in graphic design, I have since I first saw Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark.&amp;nbsp; And while the design and art that I create are not that amazing, it calms my mind as I move binary colors around.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I feel the same way about most digital forms of art, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; Digital Photography brings me a type of instant result not found in any other form of media.&amp;nbsp; The creation of digital music grants me the authority to be as ridiculous as I want.&amp;nbsp; And digitally editing video, once empowered only to those with money (and skill), has been given to everyone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Google&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This is just super.&amp;nbsp; Can I say that?&amp;nbsp; I regularly check my site statistics, just to see where I'm at and catch a glimpse of where my visitors are coming from.&amp;nbsp; In just the past week, I've seen a marked rise in both search engine hits and random visitors.&amp;nbsp; That's good news.&amp;nbsp; Why, you can punch in the words "Cucina Tagliani's" and there I will be, right on the top of the second page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I just hope no one is disappointed when they look for restaurant reviews and stumble upon the Blog.&amp;nbsp; Although, with as many words as I have on this site, one can search for many things and end up here. &amp;nbsp; Poor souls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For example:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
neil diamond's wife&lt;br /&gt;
chris cross&lt;br /&gt;
don't drown your food&lt;br /&gt;
what is an imp&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The above mentioned random phrases manage to bring my site up.&amp;nbsp; Whatever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Move&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As this is Thursday's entry, I must make a valid disclaimer for Friday.&amp;nbsp; I'll be moving during most of the day time, and I don't know where my computer will be after the dust has settled.&amp;nbsp; So, an entry may be written, or it may not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
See you later.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>The Police</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I decided to listen to some Police CD's tonight. Man, this is fine, fine material. I'd prefer at this moment to have some old 45's to listen to, but I'd imagine only my brother would have access to those. I think that I'm missing out on something in the music by listening to it in digitally encoded bits.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Long day at work today. And by that, I mean, long with nine "o's". Wife is at work again tonight, so I get to hang out with the cat. Ho hum. There is only so much entertainment one can experience with a hyper kitten. I came home tonight to a ball of yarn strewn about the house in the shape of the Star of David, I'm wondering if the cat is trying to tell me something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As a side note, you should never try to spray PAM on your oven rack. The end result is not pretty, and involves a great deal of smoke. Consider this: I learned my lesson the hard way. And my pizza tasted like plastic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I finally got my hands on the new DVR unit that my employer has been touting for the past four months. It's quite a nice piece of equipment, and I'm sure Wife and I will enjoy the recording features. 50 hours of digitally recorded content ought to save just about 100 Simpsons episodes, but that's only if I had it my way. Actually, now that I think about, the Simpsons holds the same influence over her mind too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The cat just jumped up into my arms, which is making my typing very labored and difficult. That's my cue to end tonights little blog. Plus, he's right in front of my face now, and I can't se wht I m tyogng. Good nght. See ou next week!&lt;/div&gt;

I suppose that&amp;#39;s an Arizona snowball. &lt;p&gt;Lens: John S&lt;br&gt;Film: Claunch 72 Monochrome</content>

    <title>Not a chore</title>
    <content type='html'>I must say that I'm fairly delighted that this blog hasn't turned into a chore. &amp;nbsp;I enjoy writing too much for this to become tiresome. &amp;nbsp;Although I admit that at times, I spend about an hour conjuring up clever thought. &amp;nbsp;It hasn't yet come to me that easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I will admit that the entries have been dry at times. &amp;nbsp;But as of this time, we're striving for quantity over quality. &amp;nbsp;The value will come soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;It's been increasingly difficult to concentrate while at work, a direct result of the holiday season coupled with being married, I imagine. &amp;nbsp;My mind wanders with very little effort, and I'm sure that my performance is lacking in several measurable areas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I have faith that this feeling will surrender itself after the holidays are spent, as Wife and I will begin counting down the days until Baby gets here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It should be noted that I felt the baby kick this past week. &amp;nbsp;For those who have not yet felt this experience, I apologize. &amp;nbsp;It is a wholly remarkable feeling. &amp;nbsp;I've been quite jealous that Wife has felt these tremors lately, as I have waited quite patiently for this to become strong enough for me to feel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I can feel it whenever I want to (wife permitting). &amp;nbsp;I'm still excited and scared at the same time (cliché). &amp;nbsp; It depends on the day. &amp;nbsp;At times, I can picture it perfectly and serenely, holding the little infant in my arms and looking into his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And still other times, the more worrisome feelings creep into my head and I don't know how I'll keep up with things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in the end, the positive emotions always win, and I have faith in the fact that this baby will have the best parents possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Countdown status: &amp;nbsp;10 days. &amp;nbsp;Is everything in order? &amp;nbsp;We've still got ground to gain. &amp;nbsp;With that said, good look on your holiday endeavors, and I'll see you back here tomorrow morning. &amp;nbsp;Sorry, no picture tonight. &amp;nbsp;Tomorrow!</content>

&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht_JPKKNIgMZHHm-UrBvRlBmEb_u9h910TF9LIUUSS0p7dp4ZqrZTLbyYzTO3hpJ-4HNrPaDgRwECD65px2uaLrG0MzMrQcaESqNbNBpVKL2djz8xEqTNoYB5HRBY5_VG_3-Qq/s1600/melo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht_JPKKNIgMZHHm-UrBvRlBmEb_u9h910TF9LIUUSS0p7dp4ZqrZTLbyYzTO3hpJ-4HNrPaDgRwECD65px2uaLrG0MzMrQcaESqNbNBpVKL2djz8xEqTNoYB5HRBY5_VG_3-Qq/s1600/melo.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The only reason that I went was to see number 15.&amp;nbsp; Carmelo Anthony, one of the youngest players ever in the NBA.&amp;nbsp; I wonder how many times we'll say that...eventually, they'll find a way to get a 17 year old in, as long as he's graduated from High School.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Another hour, another idea...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, not exactly. I stole this from my elder brother adam. In fact, most of what I'm doing now is just a rip-off of his great ideas. Here is a link for where you can look at any pictures that I post. Just click on "pictures" on the left of the screen, and you should get there. Note: There are no pictures yet. Muah hah. It's an MSN community, slow as all get-out, but it's free and Americans like them freethings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I'm an american.&lt;br /&gt;
I thought you knew that.&lt;br /&gt;
You did?&lt;br /&gt;
oh.&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>What is this, 2002?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while. &amp;nbsp;A fairly long decade, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings to me to what makes starting again so difficult...there's simply no conceivable way to summarize what's happened over the past 3,650 days. &amp;nbsp;What's more, I haven't much of a penchant for reliving the past whether in deed or, in this project's objective, word. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we'll start fresh, right here, right now. &amp;nbsp;Keeping it simple with the same domain I've had since the year 2000. &amp;nbsp;Dumped all of the old blog posts (all 415 of them) into the archive, and maybe...just maybe...some of them will resurface in the coming weeks, months, and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that I am grateful for new starts, creative energies, and noise cancelling headphones. &amp;nbsp;And not necessarily in that order.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Monsoon</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;While downstairs cleaning this&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;afternoon&lt;/b&gt;, the sunlight entering through my eastern windows faded quickly.&amp;nbsp; Crossing my fingers, I walked out the front door and snapped a few pictures for good measure.&amp;nbsp; A storm was brewing just northeast of my location, and luckily seemed to be heading my way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I should mention that I love the monsoon season in Arizona...I know many others do not share my predilection.&amp;nbsp; But these summer storms have a certain je ne sais quoi...a seeming ability to transcend the boiling rut of summer and make it feel new again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Many of the sentiments date back to the elementary school years, when those precious summer months meant something entirely different than they do now.&amp;nbsp; As creatures of curious stimulus, we sometimes find comfort in those few stable elements of our lives that repeat each year ad nauseum...The monsoons are as such for me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

    <title>Weight, inexplicable</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Another Arizona morning dawned, its brief coolness already a fading memory as the sun climbed with its usual, relentless pursuit of diurnal progress. It's a familiar feeling, this quickening warmth, a stark reminder that we're on the cusp of another brutal summer. And with it, that particular internal shift—a&amp;nbsp;reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder&amp;nbsp;that pushes me inward, where the relentless glare outside means days spent within walls, the sky a distant, unreachable memory. A strange anxiety settles then, a quiet melancholy that hums beneath the surface of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:504"&gt;And then, there was the scale. That unfeeling, digital oracle, delivering its pronouncement this morning: a number too close to the most I've ever carried, a moment of sharp chagrin. So, the usual ritual: a pilgrimage to a brightly lit, cavernous store, a defensive maneuver against the easy lure of the outside world. The carts clanged with the&amp;nbsp;weight of resolutions, and even there, the sting of rising costs, the daily revelation that everything simply costs more, became another small, dull ache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:360"&gt;My chosen solace in those aisles rarely deviates. Certain prepared meals are my anchors, offering a primal, familiar comfort. They aren't bastions of health, no, but there's a particular joy in the crisp, almost burnt edges. And so, with a few carefully chosen provisions, I make my quiet stand against the creeping cost of things, both monetary and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:415"&gt;When the summer heat truly traps me, my mind seeks its own familiar havens. The vibrant, pixelated worlds of childhood games become a kind of&amp;nbsp;intellectual comfort food, a familiar, challenging distraction, a momentary reprieve from the relentless churning of everyday thoughts. It's there, in those familiar landscapes, that my mind can chase its meandering thoughts without being crushed by the weight of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:544"&gt;But the truth, raw and unvarnished, is that the true weight I carry transcends the numbers on a scale or the price of a packaged meal. It's the profound, sometimes overwhelming, gravity of simply&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;. There are young shoulders close to me carrying burdens far too heavy for their years, navigating complexities born of life's intricate, sometimes messy, tapestry. They are on a journey that reminds me of the rapid unfolding of life, and the innocent moments that perhaps passed too quickly, swallowed by the demands of a complicated world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:646"&gt;The echoes of my own past resonate too: the shifting landscapes of divorce, the constant migrations, the new beginnings. So many lives now, so many challenges, a constant, shifting kaleidoscope of change. Sometimes, the sheer enormity of it all—the responsibility, the love, the unavoidable pain—it feels like&amp;nbsp;one wave after another dragging me under. In those moments, a wistful longing for a temporal rewind takes hold, a yearning to re-thread the past. This is the intricate, beautiful, and sometimes brutally heavy life I find myself navigating now, a&amp;nbsp;symphony of blessings and burdens played on strings that feel increasingly frayed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Long Monday</title>
    <content type='html'>Welcome back. &amp;nbsp;It was a long Monday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, I just couldn't pull myself out of bed. &amp;nbsp;Try as I could, the bed was much too warm and the air much too unfriendly. &amp;nbsp;In humility, I had to ask the wife for a ride to work because I just didn't have the enthusiasm to ride my scooter in the frigid air outside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I don't mean to complain, but who said that it could drop below 40 degrees?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, came work. &amp;nbsp;Drudgery in every facet of the meaning. &amp;nbsp;I watched the clock (that was my first mistake) as the time ticked by, minute by every minute. &amp;nbsp;And it was one of those days where every task you do has that same distinctive flavor of the worst scenario possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hmm...that paragraph resounded of even more complaining. &amp;nbsp;Let's try again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After work, I decided that it was the right time to take my wife out to dinner. &amp;nbsp;We visited one of our most favorite joints in town, a little Italian diner called Cucina Tagliani's. &amp;nbsp;I admit that it is quickly becoming my favorite Italian cuisine, surpassing even the famed and gloried Olive Garden. &amp;nbsp; I don't know, but I think Olive Garden tastes flat and pales in comparison. &amp;nbsp;The only saving grace of O.G. is their signature salad (dressing).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I get the same thing every time; the lunch-sized pasta bowl with marinara sauce and ground sausage. &amp;nbsp;The flavor is derived from the sausage. &amp;nbsp;And I should mention that their bread is way better than O.G.'s, too. &amp;nbsp;That does it: Cucina Tagliani's is my new fave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you're in Arizona, you ought to pay a visit. &amp;nbsp;It's never too busy, and the atmosphere there is slightly more authentic and 10x more friendly than your usual garden variety restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other news: &amp;nbsp;I purchased a 512 megabyte flash card for my digital camera tonight. &amp;nbsp;I had to have it, it was too good of a deal to pass up. &amp;nbsp;I had taken some new pictures to post today, but I accidentally erased them. &amp;nbsp;I'm still learning how to use the thing, so bear with me. &amp;nbsp;Give me another week or so, and I'll be a pro.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that's pretty much it for today. &amp;nbsp;I'm looking forward to some good shut-eye. &amp;nbsp;Have a splendid day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Post script: &amp;nbsp;The site surpassed 2000 visits for the month. &amp;nbsp;First time ever!</content>

I'm unusually tired, so I'll be brief tonight.&amp;nbsp; In fact, just visit the link below to read an article written by my elder brother.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bloggenpucky.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://bloggenpucky.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Once you are there, read the entry from January 5th, beginning with "What is Perspective?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After you've read its entirety, please read my reply below.&amp;nbsp; Have a nice day!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Please note that if this comment sounds disjointed and vague, it must be because I'm at work...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's been said that one's opinion of life and the world around them is judged largely upon their own point-of-view. Many people lead their lives with simple and complex beliefs, drawing upon them whenever necessary (or convenient)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This convenience leads to a certain lifestyle, which they justify with previous experiences. My observation is that at times, the previous experiences are manufactured after the fact...they never existed in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, the compass that this individual has chosen has become corrupt at some point, and continually points the person in confusing directions. However, since they feel confident that they have carefully made their decision based upon previous experience, their inhibitions are cast aside and they venture ever downward into a confusing web of decision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, I find it seemingly appropriate to lean upon an external compass provided by a supernal being, or God, if you would. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The freedom is still given to make life's decisions. The individual receives further light and knowledge, therefore bringing purer confidence in each of life's decisions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, being limited in our scope, we can never be certain that our observations of the outcomes of these promptings are valid. To some, what may seem as a poor experience with this celestial compass may be the endnote: Never to be tried again. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We must have faith and succumb our will to the provider of this compass...we must concede that our best interest is always involved, and that whatever happened...happened for a reason. This is simply too difficult for some to grasp and put into play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, we arrive at where we started. Thanks for your observations, Adam...you always make me think.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>Ok, since I didn't post on Thursday, I'll give you all a special treat. &amp;nbsp;It's more than a weekend edition of the Blog, oh yes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's my first song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It may only be :57 seconds long, it may not be composed of the greatest sounds. &amp;nbsp;And it just may beat into your head like a bag of hammers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;








&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/images/gb1.wma"&gt;But here it is.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;b&gt;No matter how hard I think, &lt;/b&gt;I can't come up with words to describe everything.&amp;nbsp; That is perhaps why I put this off yesterday.&amp;nbsp; Sumner may read this one day, and from this, he'll gauge the situation pretty clearly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
He's a beautiful boy.&amp;nbsp; To me and the wife, he's the most beautiful baby in the world, of course.&amp;nbsp; But there is a genuine beauty about him that cannot be dimmed.&amp;nbsp; From the very beginning, he has been nothing but full of energy and his love for Mom and Dad is apparent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Born on April 8th, 2004 at 4:46pm, Sumner James weighed in at 6 pounds, 6 ounces, and was 19.5 inches long.&amp;nbsp; After a a couple of good pushes from my wife,&amp;nbsp; the doctor and I were able to cut the cord that had placed itself firmly around his neck.&amp;nbsp; Soon after the cord was cut, my wife reached down and grabbed little Sumner, placed him gently on her tummy, and kissed his forehead before he was off to be cleaned by the attending nurses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was pretty concerned for the little guy, and followed the nurses into the next room.&amp;nbsp; All I could do was stare in amazement at him.&amp;nbsp; I knew he could hear me, and I wanted to take him in my arms and hold him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Even as I write this, I find it hard to fully describe the day, not because my memory fails me, but because I've never had to describe pure joy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And now, home with my wife and child, I can finally relax.&amp;nbsp; I can put aside all of the fears and worries that beset my mind for the past nine months.&amp;nbsp; Instead of the constant kick beneath my wife's tummy, there is now a breathing boy on my bed.&amp;nbsp; Instead of silence, there is laughter and crying.&amp;nbsp; Instead of waiting, there is patience.&amp;nbsp; In place of tossing and turning, there are midnight feedings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And instead of two, there are now three.&amp;nbsp; For little Sumner, Outside, his world is new...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Post #100</title>
    <content type='html'>And it only took me well over a year to reach that point!  &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;Oye&lt;/span&gt;.  It's the end of a long day...a true Monday, in every aspect.  It started out at 5am, as I had to venture to &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;Krispy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Kreme&lt;/span&gt; to fetch a triple dozen donuts for the work breakfast potluck.  I figured there would be a long line, as this particular location opened to much buzz and fever.  It's the only location in AZ (for the time being), and we Arizonans love our fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got there, a line I did not find.  A single solitary Chevy stood between me, the drive &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;thru&lt;/span&gt;, and a surplus of 30 minutes to my morning.  So after purchasing the pastries, I took a drive to &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;WalMart&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because everyone loves &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;WalMart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some pens, pencils, markers, etc.  I've used one particular type of pen since I found it in New York 10 years ago.  I couldn't tell you it by name, but I can find it at almost any store.  It's got a fine tip that works well with my funny writing style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was heavily anticipated because it was the date of Steve Job's keynote address at the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;WWDC&lt;/span&gt;.  I knew he'd unveil the new iPhone.  I had to wait a good portion of the day to get to the details of said phone, as I was stuck in meetings most of the morning and afternoon.  When I had a few moments to myself, I sat down at my computer, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;feverishly&lt;/span&gt; browsing the nets for information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't get into my thoughts about the changes, not just yet.  &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;That'll&lt;/span&gt; be fodder for this weekend's regular blog post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, road trip this weekend.  We're bucking the trend and gassing up the car and taking off for Lake Arrowhead for a few days.  Screw the negative economists.  I may even go see a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post has taken a turn toward pessimism.  That just tells me I need to quit for now.  Have a great night!</content>

    <title>Simple beauty</title>
    <content type='html'>I completely spaced this entry last night, so I'm entering this blog at about 6:30 in the morning. &amp;nbsp;The sun has not risen; even the peaks of the mountains do not yet show the burgundy hue of the dawn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sometimes forget the simple beauty of the still morning. &amp;nbsp;Sitting here in darkness almost persuades me to be something of a morning person. But I digress, as I completely doubt that this solitary experience could pull me out of a warm bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wife and I accomplished the majority of the remainder of our Christmas shopping last night. &amp;nbsp;It's become much harder to shop for parents now that I no longer have daily contact with them. &amp;nbsp;The tried and true staple gifts of movies and music no longer apply, as I haven't any idea what they've been listening to or seeing lately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I got them a...hmm. &amp;nbsp;Better not list that here, as my mother or father may have grown wise and learned my site lists such daily occurances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, the day dawn approaches, and I've still much to do before work begins. &amp;nbsp;Tomorrow: &amp;nbsp;You can expect something utterly hilarious (if it turned out ok). &amp;nbsp;Have a great day!</content>

    <content type='html'>My husband loves salt too. I, on the other hand, have learned that the majority of Americans eat way too much salt, and I try to limit my salt intake. Now I don&amp;#39;t even salt water for pasta anymore.</content>

    <title>03/31/2009 - Now this tale didn&amp;#39;t happen just yesterday, nor the day
before, but long, long ago</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;I realized today &lt;/strong&gt;that I hadn't published any of our pictures from our awesome trip to Disneyland on March the 13th.  Here are a few of them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnerline" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnerride.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnerjenna.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnerball.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/dadadamsj.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/dadsj.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/nowthistale.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/itwasone.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/jennasumner.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnersplash.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnerlost.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sarajane.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sumnersleep.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/sjchoc.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/Disney0309/family.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="446" /&gt;</content>

But I&amp;#39;m glad I have it, still. The battery doesn&amp;#39;t last like it used to, the back wheels are worn, the motor seems a bit out of balance…but she still moves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made the decision that when it dies, that&amp;#39;s the end of it. I&amp;#39;ve had roughly 4.5 years with it so far, and haven&amp;#39;t suffered a single scrape. Sure, there&amp;#39;ve been a few falls, a couple close calls, and numerous successful bailouts, but I think I&amp;#39;ve been pretty damn lucky. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next up, an electric bike. Speed with a bit more safety, I think.</content>

    <title>Mars Rovers</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;No one mentions them much anymore, so I was surprised to hear that both the Spirit and Opportunity rovers are alive and kicking on the surface of Mars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html"&gt;http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;Just for a bit of perspective, this mission began on June 10th 2003 with the launch of the Spirit, touching down on January 3rd 2004. I'm not sure, but I believe the rovers planned tour of duty was 90 sols. I just confirmed it. As of May 2007, Spirit surpassed 1200 sols, more than 13 times the anticipated length of service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;Since 2004, both rovers have sent a steady stream of scientific data about the surface of Mars. I love reading about them, and I can't believe I've missed this much over the past few months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;Posted wirelessly!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The other Blogger driven page got really tired.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and by the way, has anybody figured out yet that i really don't know a whole lot about HTML?&amp;nbsp; This page should give you some sort of clue.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Life is sailing along.&amp;nbsp; I wish i could say the same for my dear brother.&amp;nbsp; The school district that he works (ed) for has cut him off, sending him a severely impersonal letter stating so long and thanks for all the fish.&amp;nbsp; (basically)&amp;nbsp; Oh, i can already tell that i'm in love with the parenthesis today...(yesh)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today I got a small smackeral taste of what my job will be like after my training.&amp;nbsp; All's i can say is that it's basically like dangling a steak in front of a starving dog, letting him lick it, and then flinging it out of sight.&amp;nbsp; I'm bleary eyed, half crazed, and ready to get to it.&amp;nbsp; I have to go back to the training tomorrow....GOSH.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's it for today, i have to finish fixing my friends computer.&amp;nbsp; It's been here on my work bench for like 3 weeks.&amp;nbsp; How about that for turn around time, neh?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

By the way, January is nearly over.&amp;nbsp; February, in all of its infinite clumsiness, is casting its great shadow over our lives.&amp;nbsp; Prepare ye, prepare ye your schedules of confusion.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A small story to end yer day...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
A small story to end yer day...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was sent on an errand at work today at about 4:00 pm. My task was to drive to Tempe and drop off a set of plans. Simple enough, but once i entered the freeway, my fun was over. Little did i know but i was about 10 miles from running out of gas, and i ran into some nasty traffic just outside Dunlap Avenue. "Golly", i think to myself as i putter along at about 1.3 miles per hour, praying to the gasoline gods and everything efficient and holy that my car doesn't die and i become ridiculed by every well fueled Phoenician on his or her way home from work. Prayers were answered, and i was able to make it to a "QT" gas station. I don't know what "QT" stands for, i don't want to know, all i know is the gas flowed and i was able to return to my errand as planned...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upon arrival at the destination in Tempe, i decided to lounge around a bit. I wandered about inside the red-stoned building where i dropped my goods off and found that it smelled somewhat, but not entirely like the MTC. Random, i know, but it did. When i got to my car (or money pit, as i refer to him now) I listened to NPR for a little while and learnt about a type of music called "Minimalism". The basic idea of minimalism is to take a few chords and play them over and over again, but at different tempos and rhythms. Sounds dull and trance-like, but it's amazing to me. I listened to several pieces, was incredibly pleased by the simple yet obviously complex patterns that emerged, and promptly turned the station to 104.7 to listen to "today's hottest hits". I was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh well. Life is fun. Thanks for reading...&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Two posts!</title>
    <content type='html'>11/13/03 @ 7:30pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe tonight, I should write my entry before I work on my Web site for four hours...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On my way home from work today, I had the rare experience of jet skiing the entire way. &amp;nbsp;It must have rained at least an inch throughout the time when I was at work, so the streets were flooded, as was my apartment parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a scooter that gets me to and from work (what's that? &amp;nbsp;Shut yo mouth) and I found it terribly enjoyable to tear through the water in it tonight. &amp;nbsp;As my back tire left a wake behind me, I didn't even give a second glance to find out if I splashed any unfortunate on-looker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The funny thing is that kids love that scooter. &amp;nbsp;I can't remember how many times those little tikes have asked me if they could ride it. &amp;nbsp;Sure, kids. &amp;nbsp;Go ask your mom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yoinks. &amp;nbsp;Gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can't really remember where I was going with this, but I'll try writing more later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11/13/03 @ 11:55pm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that was a huge failure. &amp;nbsp;If there is one thing that I have learned from writing these on a nightly basis, it's this: &amp;nbsp;If you have nothing to say, don't keep typing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good day to you all!</content>

    <title>From somewhere, who knows...</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;I can no longer count&lt;br /&gt;The beats of my heart&lt;br /&gt;For as the night slackens&lt;br /&gt;My caged chest quickens its pace&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching beyond what I know&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Peeling back the course layers of daily memory&lt;br /&gt;I touch the raw, contaminate night&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anxious to repair, desperate to acknowledge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And gazing up at the waxing moon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not remembering the last time it waned, never mind&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Light bursts forth from the lesser guard&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As it follows its path across the velvet sky&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel it tenderly-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I belong here, have always felt that comfort&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The bewildering entanglement, the drama, the trembling&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The solitary yet strongest portion of my soul&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stars remain circular-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Forever moving from their perch&lt;br /&gt;The whole night remains my audience&lt;br /&gt;Whispering the unprotected wind into my ears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The desert's nocturnal footsteps are invisible&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Only to the blind in heart&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(I fear we all must find ourselves longing)&lt;br /&gt;This is the lesson I learned&lt;br /&gt;From this penultimate and confused winter night&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Unexcused absence</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We ought to begin &lt;/b&gt;with a rhetorical question.&amp;nbsp; But we won't.&amp;nbsp; There are simply too many questions, and most of them are arrogantly rhetorical.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I can't help it, however.&amp;nbsp; Where have I been?&amp;nbsp; Why did I see fit to dispose of this Web site for over six months?&amp;nbsp; Haven't the past months been filled with enough viscosity to fill page after page?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Decide for yourself.&amp;nbsp; While you are pondering, find the joys of solid food &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/video/cheerio.wmv"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Note:&amp;nbsp; This file is much too large for my Web site, but I'm much too lazy to create a smaller one and my the looks of things, I ain't using too much bandwidth.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Hopefully, maintaining a Web site is similar to riding a bike.&amp;nbsp; If it's not, I'll have a nasty time of getting back into the swing.&amp;nbsp; I've already surprised myself by remembering my username and password, and the fact that I can still type and think at the same time is rather encouraging.&amp;nbsp; If I can find and promote some type of regularity with this, then I may be eligible for some flavor of medal or trophy.&amp;nbsp; Definitely not a pizza-trophy, though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As you can see by the video provided earlier, Sumner has changed by leaps and bounds.&amp;nbsp; No longer is he completely bound by the chains of gravity; on the contrary, he loves to test his limits on a daily basis to see how much more movement he can attain.&amp;nbsp; He loves Cheerios, and has found a fondness for all types of juices.&amp;nbsp; I finally talked mom out of watering everything down, although that may not have been such a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Secondly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I must apologize to any who came to this page on any type of regular basis.&amp;nbsp; And by regular, I do include those who passed by once a month.&amp;nbsp; Judging by the looks of the meter, six visits per person is rather generous.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's plenty for tonight.&amp;nbsp; I think that I have loosed the bonds of writer's block for now.&amp;nbsp; Pray that I stick with it, these are probably the years for which I will want to have some sort of record.&amp;nbsp; Cheers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>04/19/09 - A recap</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;I really should try &lt;/strong&gt;to remember what I did this weekend, only because I'm sitting here feeling too darn satisfied and accomplished.  Back, I say!  Wipe that smug look off your face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday.&lt;/strong&gt;   Only because our weekend starts on Thursday.  We knew we were in for a long weekend, with showers and parties and visiting family and what-not.  (Reading that sentence to myself, I realize I should completely avoid any complaint or heavy-handed tones)  The wife returned from work at her usual hour that evening, feeling overwhelmed and not a bit relieved at the thought of the approaching weekend.  Full of advice I was not, and so suggested we head off to dinner.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We thought an invitation to my mother-in-law was in order, and did so.  But alas, she had already eaten!  But the thoughtful woman one-upped us at that point; she offered baby-sitting.  Ah, the weekend had just gotten that much better.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some strange reason, we decided to head ourselves in the direction of our neighborhood California Pizza Kitchen.  They have good sourdough bread.  It's the reason I used to go there so much.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Side note: sign of the times, you have to request the bread now.  Even more poignant sign of the times; the bread stinks.  Only slightly resembles what it used to be, and more closely resembles damp styrofoam.  But it was eaten, of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wife and I did a real number on the poor waitress that evening.  First offense was sending back the Pepsi; it was flat and watery.  Plus I forgot that Pepsi is only ordered when eating Mexican food.  But that's an aside.  Second offense to the poor attendant was the Wife's entree.  Being the adventurous and cavalier spirit that she is, she ordered something new.  Now, she's a trooper and fought a few bites down, but several people averted their eyes after a few moments of the arrival of the dish and begged for wooden stakes to be driven through their hearts.  Oh, you didn't get my joke?  Garlic.  There was too much garlic in the dish.  Get it?  Vampires don't like garlic.  Oh, forget it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, we sent it back.  At that point, dinner was a bust, so she wanted to see the desert menu.  Ordered the Hot Fudge Sundae.  Sounded like a safe bet to me!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waitress came back with something called a Turtle Sundae, which seemed odd to me.  Odd because my wife never, ever mentioned the word "turtle", nor those numerous other words in the English language that rhyme with "turtle", such as....such as...hmm. I'm no Dr. Suess here, but I'm fairly certain there aren't any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the third offense was set in stone at that point, and away went the turtle sundae.  After a few moments the waitress came back with a sundae, minus the turtle.  That worried me.  And spoiled my appetite.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date night continued on quite effortlessly from that point.  A trip the the Fake Apple Store, where I was coaxed by the employees to display my hacked Dell Mini 9 netbook running Mac OS X.  Ok, ok, maybe I steered the conversation toward a point where they simply had to see it.  But when they actually asked, I grew afraid and asked if I was allowed to.  Afterall, did I not break the EULA?  Hogwash.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And what would a date be like without a trip to Wal*Mart? Lucky for you readers we don't have to find out, because there was Wal*Mart.  Oh, yes.  I'll spare you the details.  Synopsis: we bought a lot of crap that we didn't need, but will always end up using.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt; was a very lazy day.  Didn't even leave the house until 2'ish in the afternoon, when it was time to hunt down fruits and vegetables for the baby shower the Wife was throwing that evening.  First stop was Fresh and Easy, which has never proven to be either or, as this particular location always smells like old celery and involves us carting down one aisle before turning back for the door.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sprouts ended up being a wiser decision for us, and besides; they have bulk candy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later that evening, it was just me and the boy.  Sumner and I had great time, ordered pizza, ate most of it, watched Madagascar 2, played video games, and made cupcakes.   Sadly for him, he fell asleep right before the first batched popped out of the oven.  I saved him plenty.  Which he's not allowed to eat.  Muah hah hah. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &lt;/strong&gt;my friend Neal came over to play Super Metroid.  By my count, this now makes just over 12 years that we have been playing that game together, and we show no signs of stopping now.  I'm always grateful for his visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the afternoon arrived, we packed up the family and headed for Maricopa, some 45 miles southwest of our location in Mesa.  A birthday party for my wife's boss' son, and Sumner was invited.  You may have already seen the pictures from this raucous occasion.  A wonderful individual with a half dozen or so snakes and lizards came to entertain the kids and adults alike.  Everything from a lizard that would fit in your hand, to a 17 foot Python he brought, and the kids loved every minute of it.  Sumner let the man put one six foot python around his neck, and I'm still reeling from the shock.  The boy runs from the sight of a seven pound dog.  Amazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Put the kids to sleep that night and watched The Quantum of Solace, which was great.  It was a good night for a Bond flick.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday &lt;/strong&gt;was spent at my folks house, eating wonderful steak and potatoes and brownies, watching Sumner play outside like a loon, and relaxing a bit.  Came home after a few hours, tidied up the home, and settled down.  Being void of cable TV, HULU.com came to the rescue and allowed us to catch up on Scrubs and The Office.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all brings me here, 927 words later, to the point where I sit here on my bed, typing away on a keyboard that is much too small for comfort, compelled by some unknown force to give you all a traveling journal of my weekend with the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you enjoyed it even a quarter as much as I did, then I know you smiled.  Thanks for the read, come back again tomorrow.</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
The wife persuaded me (like it took much effort) to decorate the Christmas tree this evening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we're a little early. &amp;nbsp;I can think of a few friends (ahem, Eric?) that would be less than pleased with my premature celebration of Navidad. &amp;nbsp;That's ok, old boy. &amp;nbsp;There's only 36 days left.</content>

    <title>Tired</title>
    <content type='html'>I'm sorry. &amp;nbsp;I can't really think straight tonight. &amp;nbsp;I'm mind numbingly drained today. &amp;nbsp;I had big plans for my site, I was really going to go to town on a few pages. &amp;nbsp;But the minute hand paced by quicker than my will, and that will definitely take its toll on my ol' blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least it's not a one-word entry, because I was going to simply leave it at the first line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
News: &amp;nbsp;Sting announced his new Tour. &amp;nbsp;Three minutes later, the site went down. &amp;nbsp;But for some reason, I doubt that it was because of a flood of traffic. &amp;nbsp;Rather, I suspect a very poorly designed Web site and an e-mail newsletter that was sent out prematurely. &amp;nbsp;Hmm. &amp;nbsp;So as of 9:01pm, I still have no clue of when Sting is to perform here in Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other news: &amp;nbsp;Strong Bad has finally put my feelings into song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sheesh. I just read James Lileks' entry for today, and it appears to be a two parter. &amp;nbsp;More tomorrow! &amp;nbsp;What I would give to have enough verbiage for a decent one-parter. &amp;nbsp;But that's ok; my brother assures me that I should be there someday. &amp;nbsp;And I trust him, because I've trusted him before and it hasn't gotten me into too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's it for today, I'm afraid. &amp;nbsp;Sorry to disappoint. &amp;nbsp;But I'll be back tomorrow, and hopefully eight hours of sleep richer.</content>

    <title>For the sake of the blog</title>
    <content type='html'>It's beginning to be quite difficult to come up with enough literature to fill up an entire entry. &amp;nbsp;My job takes up most of the time, and not much happens there anyway. &amp;nbsp;And besides, whatever interesting information I have from that sphere of life can't really be written online, as I could somehow get fired for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lately, my nights have been taken up, as well. &amp;nbsp;I'd love to sit down for an hour or two and really hammer out some thoughts on life at this moment. &amp;nbsp;I want to paint a vivid picture for any who read this on a diurnal basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that simply cannot be. &amp;nbsp;I have too much going on, and not enough of it is important enough to mention, really. &amp;nbsp;I expect things to pick up, but that may leave me with less time to write and more time to enjoy what I'm doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is that a curse? &amp;nbsp;Of course not. &amp;nbsp;It just means that whatever scribble you see here might just be nothing more than what you read tonight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An entry for the sake of the blog! &amp;nbsp;Promise kept. &amp;nbsp;See you tomorrow!</content>

    <title>Sick</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, I woke up sick this morning...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I hate that feeling that you get when you first wake up. You know the one I'm talking about, when your chest feels like your bed decided to lay on you halfway through the night? Yeah, that one. I have this interminable cough that just won't leave me alone. Sure, it takes vacations every once in a while, but apparently it got tired of wherever it was the past few weeks and is here to curse my life again. So I ended up not going into work today, which in and of itself isn't bad, but tomorrow I know I'll wake up feeling even worse, and then I won't want to call in sick because then I look like a pansy. You should never ever call in sick the first day you feel bad. I think it should be a rule.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Well, our ward did play our first basketball game tonight, and we won 64-44. Twas an excellent game. I think one poor old guy ruptured his Achilles tendon right when the game started though. The first rule when you are 50 years old and trying to play with kids half your age has been and always will be: Stretch. So anyway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Krystal ....this is your paragraph, Your very own paragraph on my little silly-site. Now, don't go saying I don't care about you. And to all the rest of my friends in Provo, Marci, Cat, Britney, Sarah, Janelle, John, you must be included in Krystal's paragraph too. I hope all is well in BYU town.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Carpe Diem.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title/>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ah, the power of the written word...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
In light of the recent inconveniences with my apartment, I wrote a complaint letter to my management.&amp;nbsp; It was your standard issue request: Make me happy or I'll become even more annoying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And I hated to do it because I get so many of those types of letters all day long.&amp;nbsp; But, seeing how I read them all day, who better to write one?&amp;nbsp; And you know what?&amp;nbsp; It worked.&amp;nbsp; They responded by telling me that I could have my choice of apartments, and they waived the transfer fee. (whoever made up that fee needs to have a stern talking to)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So we'll be moving in two weeks.&amp;nbsp; Oh, the extra space will be so nice.&amp;nbsp; I feel like quoting Hugh Grant's line in "Two Weeks Notice" every now and then&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"It's really quite amazing how small this apartment really is.&amp;nbsp; Do you know I can walk from one side to the other in six seconds?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And so on, and so forth.&amp;nbsp; I know, that wasn't that funny.&amp;nbsp; It probably wasn't even worth a weak chuckle.&amp;nbsp; But it's amusing to me!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Got another CD from AOL today.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Although they aren't the perpetual thorn in my side that most people make them out to be.&amp;nbsp; However, I find their newest assumption to be quite shocking.&amp;nbsp; The DVD sized package itself was addressed to "Current Resident", but the outside of the DVD box clearly stated, "Come back for 2 months free!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Apparently, AOL can now assume that they have a pretty good chance of reaching someone that left them for the competition.&amp;nbsp; Makes you feel good, doesn't it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The irony of the matter is that I was just looking for a DVD case to replace one that was damaged.&amp;nbsp; Well, I got my wish.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In other news.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail93.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;What would you do if Gordon Lightfoot was creeping around your back stair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Hopefully I wouldn't enlist the help of any Popcorn Air Poppers. Confused?&amp;nbsp; Better click on the link above.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Good day to everything.&amp;nbsp; See you tomorrow. Warning.&amp;nbsp; Extended three day weekend approaches.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if there will be anything Friday, yet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>After all, what comprises me</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;There are so many aspects of my personality that cause me grief. &amp;nbsp;Sticking points that have lasted years and years, rough patches that surface every so often, areas of scarred-over distinction that were seemingly discarded through careful meditation and therapy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even still, there are things about myself that, having once been abhorred, became a comfortable part of who I am. &amp;nbsp;I have an unceasing predilection for diet beverages (colorful way of describing my addiction, natch). &amp;nbsp;My inability to attach comfort in large groups of people has allowed me to look inwardly and embrace that part of myself. &amp;nbsp;Indeed, it used to bother me to no end that I felt so exhausted after speaking in public or spending much more than a few hours in the company of strangers. &amp;nbsp;Time and education have greatly diminished the anxiety that came with the ambiguity of cognitive dissonance. &amp;nbsp;I have much to be grateful for that I have been allowed to live as long as I have and experience a fuller breadth of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others negativities come to mind, but it is oddly provocative how well I have been able to find peace with aspects of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to digress back to the beginning to find the fulcrum of this entry, so that we can take a deeper dive mentally into what makes me tick. &amp;nbsp;Rather, it's the tock that matters to me for now, if we consider life's yin and yang aspect to the metronomic imbalances we encounter. (enough with the unnecessarily complicated metaphors, RD....)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been seasons in my adult years where I was able to find success in pushing down and away those aspects of me that, for whatever reason, are unrefined and indelicate. &amp;nbsp;I have bouts of anger that I am never proud of, but that's not it. &amp;nbsp;I have an uncanny ability to yoyo about with workout regimen, dietary endeavor, and other approaches to health. &amp;nbsp;But that's not it, either. &amp;nbsp;Nor is it my inability to finish school, maintain a level approach to friendships, or help around the house with regulatory and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>One year</title>
    <content type='html'>God grant that I can say the right words here…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve been debating this for weeks now. Whether to mark this day with my own words or not. Every time I caught a glimpse of today’s date I would get a little uneasy in my seat, uncomfortable in my&lt;br /&gt;
own body. Maybe it was that I myself had forgotten. Maybe, it was the uncertainty that still laid hold of my mind at times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a somber day. It’s a day of quiet reflection, as it should be for all Americans, for the whole world. I can never forget how naked I felt that day, even in the midst of the strongest mountains of the Rockies, I felt strangely exposed. The connections that held me to each person that I knew were shattered; at once, I felt alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn’t convince myself to drive down the canyon after work. I couldn’t pull myself away from the news. My soul was numb; my hands felt like they weren’t my own. I walked outside to the south&lt;br /&gt;
side of the resort. Looking up at the great mountains beside me, I said a silent prayer for those who were lost. I called my mother and heard her trembling voice as she kept saying “no, it’s not possible”. My mother realized it, the world had changed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had to listen to my sister cry as I told her to turn the TV on. I should have let her sleep. I wanted her to be a world away from me, in a different time where she wouldn’t have to see the flames and&lt;br /&gt;
the blood. But she too, lived in this world on the morning of September 11th, 2001.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could hear Allie in the background, she was up, and she was playing. My niece had no idea how the world was changing. All she knew was she was safe; she had her mother there beside her to take care of her. She was feeling what I wish I could. I believe now, upon silent recollection, that it was my young niece that pulled me away from that scene. She was the thing that could bring me back to the world I knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I called my brother Adam, whose voice had always been one of reason and calming for me in my life. As expected, nothing had changed there, he could still comfort me but I could sense a strange transition in his demeanor. I asked how his class was handling the day, he said they were scared, confused, angry, all of the emotions which we were all feeling in the aftermath of the attack on our country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, I felt the connections to my family and friends come back to me, I felt a little more whole. Maybe it was hearing their voices that brought harmony to my soul. And as I sit here, one full year later, I am thankful that I feel not only like myself again, but more of a man than I was before that day. I was given the chance to grow up in the world, not to let it shape me but to refine; I take the greatest elements of what life is and incorporate them. I see how the world has done just that, I see the attitudes of a million Americans standing in solidarity, proclaiming with one voice, “we will never forget”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And may God grant that we never will, one way or another.</content>

    <title>04/01/2009 - Before and after</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;I really wanted &lt;/strong&gt;to post something April Fools style today, but the uncanny number of Web sites and blogs pulling pranks was staggering enough to turn me off of it pretty quickly.  You never know what to believe on a day like this.  It's like one early poster said, "April Fools + The Internet = Crap".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, instead of a hastily concocted lie about pregnancy or moving or some other nonsense, I thought I'd post a few pictures of the new yard for your enjoyment!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" title="Backyard" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/newback1.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" title="Backyard2" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/newback2.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" title="Backyard3" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/newback3.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire project flowed smooth as silk; I can't really think of anything major that stopped the show.  It's nice to have a place to relax outside now, the kids seem to have a good time and Sumner likes having another place to go other than out in front.  We've already watched two movies outside.  We rented "Bolt" the other night.  It wasn't that bad, really.  The voice acting by Travolta (Bolt) was really well done, too.  It sounds like he had fun during the production.  I can't imagine many other "jobs" more entertaining than voice-over work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So other than what you see in the pictures, we're still waiting on and budgeting for a new grill, a fire pit (or a chimney stove?  not sure now) and further plants and trees.  Speaking of the budget, we blew through money so fast with this endeavor that we haven't gone grocery shopping, even though we're way, way past due for a trip.  I mean, we're getting creative with our meals.  Today, I made rice.  I've never actually made rice for myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the wife and I made a list of the things we'll need when we go this Friday, and the length is staggering.  Seeing as how the local grocers are throwing all sorts of sales, right now seems the perfect time to go.  Maybe it'll only cost us a billion and a half dollars, instead of a quadrillion.  We'll see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other news, &lt;/strong&gt;you may have noticed my Facebook status the other day, when I mentioned that I am starting to volunteer at Banner Gateway hospital.  Seeing how I have a bit of free time now and again, and how I'd like to change career paths, the hospital seemed like a good choice.  It's local, maybe only a five minute drive from my house, and I've wanted to look into becoming a nurse.  Yes, I know. You can call me a "murse", if this all pans out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I went to get a TB test (looks good so far), and  I'll go back again in a week to get a second screening.  You know, just in case the first test is wrong.  The CDC recommends it.  How often is the first test wrong?  I guess enough times to warrant this double-test, neh?  After the background check comes back, I'll be cleared to go and working in the ICU.  The Volunteer Coordinator gave me the gist of the responsibilities, and it sounds awesome.  I think it'll give me a good idea whether I want to do nursing or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to go, &lt;/strong&gt;for now.  I've reached 500 words, which is more than most wish to read during the time set aside for blog-hopping.  Thanks for the visit, and come back as you wish.</content>

    <title>03/24/2009 - Welcome to the new blog, plus a chance to win!</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;Hello, what's this?  A new blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had a heck of a time getting this new site ready for launch.  I thought that it'd be nice and easy...install a new blogging software on my Web site, take the main page down for a while, and voila...but no!  I had 42 headaches to contend with.  But now I can take a deep breath, relax, and begin posting the daily rants and ramblings of my mind.  And I hope you'll find some entertainment value in reading what I have to say.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because if you're new here, &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/archive.htm"&gt;you may notice that I've been writing posts for a while&lt;/a&gt;.  Seven years, to be exact.  Well before such publishing tools like Blogger, Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter became insanely popular, I was trying my hardest to get content online.  I've met some success throughout the years, but have been reduced to smithereens over and over again because of my uncanny ability to wax lazily into oblivion.  Why do I feel like this time will be any different?  I suppose I never said that.  I'm just crossing my fingers this time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, to those of you who haven't stopped by here before&lt;/strong&gt;, welcome.  What do I do with this site?  The blog page, which you find yourself at currently, is the main portion of the site.  This is where I spend the most time pruning and cultivating the inner workings of my mind.  I try hard to stay relevant, sticking to topics that matter to people that read my work.  Religion, politics, and similar subjects are not necessarily taboo, but rarely discussed here.  But again, trying to stay relevant, they may pop up more as time goes along.  And I must admit, long blocks of text aren't my thing.  Normally, there will be pictures to go along with whatever story I have here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other sections of the site include the &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com"&gt;Moblah'g&lt;/a&gt;, which is powered solely by my iPhone.  There's rarely anything said here of real substance; but there you'll find some of the best personal pictures around.  There's just something about having a camera that can post anything your eye sees, whenever the mood strikes you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll also find examples of &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt;, but I must warn you...this is not my strong area.  In recent years, I've noticed the literal explosion of Web sites dedicated to close friends who have discovered the flair for digital photography.  Many of my friends and acquaintances are exceptional at their art, and they nobly make it known with remarkable finesse.  I make no such statement with my photography.  Indeed, as is mentioned on the front page of Outsidetheworld, these pictures are simply what I saw when I was lucky enough to have a camera by my side.  Hopefully I'll get a bit better with time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignleft" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gc/designs/email/default-thumb._V240362585_.gif" alt="" width="125" height="80" /&gt;So, that's it for now.&lt;/strong&gt;  You'll notice that I have a bit of a promotion going on right now, so if you'll be kind and leave a comment at the end of this post, you'll be entered to win one of two $10.00 Amazon.com gift certificates.  To be sure I know who you are, please leave your name.  Any other type of personally identifiable information isn't necessary.  Anyone who leaves a comment will have their name put into a hat for the drawing.   Comment as much as you'd like, but you'll only get one entry.  Sorry!  I have to maintain some semblance of order here.  The contest will run until Saturday night at midnight.  The winners will be announced by Monday.  I'll run campaigns like this every so often to show my efforts toward maintaining a respectable and consistent blog, so keep your eye on the site and bookmark me, neh?  I promise to make it worth your while!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geez.  I've spent way&lt;/strong&gt; too much time in front of the computer today.  Time to go play some basketball.  Sorry for the heavy tone of this entry!  I promise to be much more candid in the weeks to come.  This really doesn't even sound like me.  I suppose I'm trying to put my best foot forward, as I only have this chance to make a good impression.  See you next time!</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Heavy winds, lots of clouds, and plenty of fresh air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
But only if you don't have allergies. Then you might be a bit sore today. I just got home from work and had a great desire to do some more work to the site, so i've added some new pictures and a few new pages to the mix. In all, it appears that i might be gaining ground on my goal to create a more aesthetically pleasing view for Outside The World. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
My remote control is ergonomic. Is yours?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It should be.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Breaks</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Too many breaks between writings...&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's amazing how time consuming a website can become. It can take over entire evenings with little effort; midnight rolls around rather quickly as you try to rework your tables and make your site cooperate the way you wish it would. Even a small site like mine can be a great distraction, as i haven't had the desire to write any entries. Today, no more meaningless talk about the change of the site, that's done. Complete. Whammo. The magic that was the transition has worked its way into the event horizon of the web. This week: McDonald's actually can be sued for a good reason, Trip to California, and other delightful jewels.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As i often listen to the radio personalities in the morning, i do hear a great deal of junk stories. The other day i heard that there was a class action lawsuit being brought against McDonalds in Great Britain. Apparently over 30 people have suffered "serious burns" due the the scalding hot nature of McDonald's coffee. Their lawyer, Mr. I.B Jackass, says that the warning on the tops and sides of the coffee cups are insufficient and misleading. That's true, because sometimes you can mistake "Warning: Extremely Hot!" for "Hey, this may be warm, but put it in your lap anyways and burn your procreative powers away". Needless to say, this is ridiculous and while i feel for any person that was burned by McDonalds hot black nonsense, the lawsuits are probably going to be ignored. Then Tuesday happened to me...&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I went to the McDonalds on 7th Street and Bell. I was in the vicinity because of a delivery for work, and i knew that this certain location accepted debit cards so i went there. As it ended up, the terminal by the register was broken, so the young lady behind the counter asked me to step into the kitchen itself and use the one for the drive thru. Not really giving this a second thought, i passed by the hot oil and the grills on the way to the terminal. While i was walking back, however, i slipped on a spot of grease beside the grill, and nearly placed my left hand on top of it. Close call. For them.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yes, i was stupid enough to walk back there. And i probably wouldn’t have done anything anyway, i gladly confess that i'm not one of the sue happy in this society. But it's just too bad that companies like McDonalds are taken advantage of by clueless consumers that have delusions that they have somehow, in someway, been taken advantage of. People just believe what they want to believe.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyway, my point was lost somewhere amidst all of that writing. If you found one, great! But i wouldn't peruse much longer. Tomorrow, i leave to California for a couple of days. I'll be sure and post as many pictures as possible and write about the great adventures that surely await me in the land of so much style and very little substance. As i don't think i'll have much time to post this weekend, i wish you all a safe and happy weekend.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Make sure to check the media portion of my site next week..... Tchau.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Chicken Enchiladas</title>
    <content type='html'>Fairly quiet day, if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, it was so quiet that I really haven't much to say. &amp;nbsp;Wife made me my favorite dish tonight, I believe that I've mentioned them before. &amp;nbsp;She makes the most delicious chicken enchiladas I have ever tasted (and I've eaten quite a few).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Work today was much the same, except it went by very slowly. &amp;nbsp;I expect that this is because I only have two more days of work left until Thanksgiving, or Dia De Pollo. &amp;nbsp;I can remember back when I was serving my mission in New York City, around this same time of year. &amp;nbsp;I was so sick with the Flu, I couldn't move, I couldn't eat, I couldn't even talk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still believe till this day that I contracted that nasty virus from the wonderful health clinic where I received my Flu vaccination. &amp;nbsp;I don't believe that I'll ever try one of those again, thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I must be off...sorry about the extreme shortness of my entries lately. &amp;nbsp;I expect to have some lengthier entries later on in the week, and I'll be sure to write about all of the Turkey Day happenings. &amp;nbsp;Oh, on a sad note, this will be the first year ever that I do not participate in the Turkey Bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More later!</content>

    <content type='html'>See, I think the difference is that you're not going to camp out for a new gadget.  I can't fathom why these people do something like that.  A pampered society, we are.  Camping out for a new phone is pretty unhealthy (mentally and otherwise) if you ask me.</content>

    <title>Nintendo's E3 Press Conference - Impressions</title>
    <content type='html'>Before the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;mainstream&lt;/span&gt; blogging pages erupt with their own opinions on &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"&gt;Nintendo's&lt;/span&gt; showcase , I thought I'd put a few words down now that the lights have gone down. As anticipated, Reggie &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Fils&lt;/span&gt;-Aime began the conference by stating the cold, hard facts: Nintendo has once again owned the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sales of video game related products are up 46% in the Americas, 42% in Europe, and nearly 115% in Japan. Most of this growth is spurred on by the immense success of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;Nintendo's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;DS&lt;/span&gt; consoles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Console sales is nearly split 50/50 between handheld and home console gaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nintendo announced today a new "Zapper" style &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;, which marries both the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; Remote and the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;Nunchuk&lt;/span&gt; into a &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"&gt;bizarre&lt;/span&gt; looking yet functional device for first person shooters. Reggie hinted that Nintendo was hard at work with a pack in piece of software for the Zapper, which I truly believe could be the next iteration of Duck Hunt. Price point? $19.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reggie also announced that Super Smash Bros Brawl would release in the Americas on December 3rd, 2007. Good news for many, though I still haven't gotten enough play out of Super Smash Bros Melee. I'm sure it pleased the audience though, as many were anticipating the date related announcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit discouraged after this announcement, as Reggie &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11"&gt;veered&lt;/span&gt; off the future path and started discussing more current events and successes. That was quickly resolved, however as a brief presentation was shown on already revealed and dated games "The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass" and "&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"&gt;Metroid&lt;/span&gt; Prime 3: Corruption." It was great to see the near finished product for MP3; the graphics look amazing and the control looks tight. When it comes out, I'm buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, an announcement that I did not see coming, but that I was very excited to hear. Mario Kart &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; will be released with full online play in the first quarter of 2008. That, my friends, is exciting. Reggie announced that if online play is good, then online play with "more" racers must be even better. He didn't go into any detail, except to say that details would follow throughout the year. When it comes out, I'm buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the moment I was waiting for. Reggie finally announced the release date for Super Mario Galaxy; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14"&gt;November&lt;/span&gt; 12&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;, 2007. I found it funny that he has to clarify 2007. Nintendo has been notorious in the past for delaying heavily anticipated titles far off in the distance (example, both &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16"&gt;Metroid&lt;/span&gt; Prime 3 and Super Mario Galaxy were announced as launch titles alongside Zelda: Twilight Princess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video of the game looked great, and it looks like there is some two player co-op involved. Reggie said that while all Mario games deserve their place in the cannon, this was the first true successor to Super Mario 64. That says it all for me, right there. When it comes out, I'm buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the final bit of the presentation, Reggie introduced &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17"&gt;Shigeru&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18"&gt;Miyamoto&lt;/span&gt;. I remember earlier in the year, Nintendo Power interviewed &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19"&gt;Shig&lt;/span&gt; and asked him about current and future projects. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20"&gt;Miyamoto&lt;/span&gt; was very hush hush and mentioned that he was having as much fun as he ever had with his current project, but wouldn't go any further than that. We finally got a good look at that project today. A new "game" that will guarantee the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21"&gt;existence&lt;/span&gt; and proliferation of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; in not only my household, but in households across the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; Fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; Balance Board, gamers will be tested in balance, stretching, strength, yoga, and movement exercises. It looks fun. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25"&gt;Shiggy&lt;/span&gt; said that he wanted to come to E3 and introduce one game to the world. Not &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26"&gt;Metroid&lt;/span&gt; Prime 3, not Super Mario Galaxy, Not Zelda, but &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; Fit. And that is enough to make me excited for it. My wife should love it as well; in fact, I think she predicted this exact release about seven months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, there wasn't any announcements about a hard drive add on. No new &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_28"&gt;Wii&lt;/span&gt; Channels to drool over. But we did get some fairly good surprises, and overall I felt a commitment from Nintendo to both the core gamer, as well as the expanded world-wide audience they are trying to capture. I give the press conference an A- overall.</content>

    <title>More power equals more blogs?</title>
    <content type='html'>I finally took the plunge and purchased a second battery for my Treo.  I&amp;#39;m already kind of tired of losing power before I get home.&lt;p&gt;All this blogging makes my phone very sleepy. &lt;p&gt;And with that said, it&amp;#39;s time to set sail for home.  The work is done, and it&amp;#39;s time to relax.  &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>Manhole covers</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Surely I can think of something to write.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today I got to go out on the job site to look at manhole covers. Yep, beautiful, beautiful manhole covers...It was quite the experience, really. I learned that every step you take is about 3 feet long, and therefore I had to dust off the old brain and divide foot measurements by 3's. That was a tough one, but what made it worse was that I had to walk while I was dividing. I actually had to stop once, pause, divide 3 into some insanely easy number like 140 and then keep walking. For some reason, the number "7" wouldn't leave my mind. Uh huh, three must go into 140 seven times. Math is just not my gig. But honestly, you'd think that I could divide, for cryin' out loud...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But thank goodness I still have basketball. It's one of those rare beauties I have in life that makes me feel great afterward. Even when I lose, I still feel like I knew what I was doing.* Tonight I also asked this girl in my institute class on a date. Now, all I need is ideas. No more bagel dates. There can be only one of those, I'm 'fraid. Oh, and I'm sure that Adam Dawson will appreciate this one: Sleep America...where America goes TO sleep". Not FOR sleep. You were correct, much to my dismay. For a confirmation of this...please visit their website.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Inside stories. Maybe I shouldn't write them on here...nah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
*Sshhh, Kevin, quiet, Neal... Your time will undoubtedly come.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Weekends are nice.....</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
Weekends are nice.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Especially now, having worked the whole week. I actually appreciated the extra little bit o' sleep that i got this morning. You may be asking yourself, "Why&amp;nbsp;does he make it sound like a tough thing to work a week"? Well, it isn't, truly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But you must understand, my last job was working as a "Public Safety Officer"&amp;nbsp;at Snowbird ski resort. That basically consisted of staring at little camera&amp;nbsp;monitors and oh, walking around. Walking around was the hard part, you see, because i was already half asleep from staring at the aforementioned&amp;nbsp;little camera monitors by the time my relief showed. Yeah, it was a hard life.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enough of that. Let's see, something noteworthy about today...not much i&amp;nbsp;guess. I did achieve my goal of purchasing the brown bag special at Sonic today...my friend Dan and i were a bit peckish at lunch time and i'll tell you, it was 6 dollars well spent. We didn't do a whole lot else today but Dan's girlfriend Katie came by and told us that she got a job as a massage therapist...kudos to you, Katie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's about it for now, i suppose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, happy anniversary, Jake and Nicole. 1 year today!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>Out of gas</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I thought it was pretty cool &lt;/b&gt;that I went 385 miles on one tank of gas yesterday.&amp;nbsp; This feeling remained with me until this very morning, when I started my car and backed out of the driveway.&amp;nbsp; I got no more than 15 feet away (at an incline, no less), when the car sputtered to a dismal stop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It wasn't a very good start to the day, but that's the risk I took.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine any logical reason why I did not stop for gas on the way home from work; I had about 25 different options.&amp;nbsp; But, I was in a groove, man!&amp;nbsp; This driver stops for nothing.&amp;nbsp; 'Cept a lack of gas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So I worked from home &lt;/b&gt;today.&amp;nbsp; Not a bad deal, since I do the work from home thing every Friday.&amp;nbsp; This does mean that I will have to forego the process this week, as my WFH allotment is finito.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'll keep this entry brief, as I've been posted to the Moblah'g much lately and will continue to do so throughout the week.&amp;nbsp; But the site redesign is going to plan, and soon you'll see a new and improved photography page.&amp;nbsp; First things's first, though...I got to take more pictures.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/so-hot.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In 110 degree weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not the most fun thing to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Perhaps the thing to do would be to take a vacation?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.snowbird.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I can't quite think of where I want to go, though. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Oh, wait. Nevermind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's it for now!&amp;nbsp; Please head on over to the Moblah'g, if you haven't done so already.&amp;nbsp; Lots of stuff to be found there.&amp;nbsp; And please comment.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/contactus.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;drop me a note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I always appreciate the thought!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>Keeping in mind that the iPhones that I held were already pawed over by hundreds of people, they didn't look that bad.  A quick wipe and it was good to go.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;And there appears to be no easy way to scratch that glass, either.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;One particular screen looked like it had been defaced by a large spit wad, but I don't blame that on the device.</content>

&lt;b&gt;Wife and child are &lt;/b&gt;away in Mesa for the night, so that spells trouble for me.&amp;nbsp; Nights like these consist of me moping around the house just long enough to drive myself crazy and amusingly depressed.&amp;nbsp; I end up creating a new playlist for the iPod and head for the car, destined to drive...somewhere.&lt;/div&gt;

I took my camera this time, with good intentions of using it.&amp;nbsp; It being nighttime, I really didn't think I'd catch any great photo opportunities.&amp;nbsp; Might as well experiment anyway, right?&amp;nbsp; It ended up not mattering a bit anyway, the batteries were completely flat.&amp;nbsp; Ho hum.&amp;nbsp; Off to Wal-Mart!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I wasn't anywhere close to a Wal-Mart by this time, and I was well into song number 4 on my play list. (Linger, Cranberries.&amp;nbsp; Reminds me of the dances I used to go to when I was 14.&amp;nbsp; Enough random memories)&amp;nbsp; I headed up north of town to the newest store that opened up on Happy Valley Road, passing by my best friend's house on the way, of course.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Buy batteries, blah blah blah, a couple of boxes of cereal, yeah yeah.&amp;nbsp; I don't know where I'm going with this entry, you know?&amp;nbsp; I just felt the need to write something while I was driving around.&amp;nbsp; It just seems like I need some sort of catharsis this evening, but when I don't know what demons I'm driving out, it makes purging difficult, to say the least.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I did see something that just made me sad at the store tonight, though.&amp;nbsp; Stuck between the Frosted Flakes and Crispix cereals was a whole cooked chicken, wrapped in plastic, ready to be eaten.&amp;nbsp; Some jerk decided it wasn't worth their time to take this back to the eatery and just left it in the middle of the aisle to rot.&amp;nbsp; This made me sad because it's just one more reason why I'm sick of Americans lately.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What other reasons do I have?&amp;nbsp; Please, that's for another night's writings, when I have about 490% more energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm listening to Mana now, and it's proving to be a bit difficult to write in English while listening to a song in Spanish.&amp;nbsp; Good song, though.&amp;nbsp; Definitely reminds me of when my friend Jake got home from his mission in Chile and we drove around in his dad's 2001 Camaro SS.&amp;nbsp; Good times, good times.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And now, Black by Pearl Jam popped onto the play list, and my brother in law Matt sent me an instant message to tell me that I was listening to a great song.&amp;nbsp; Well said, Matt, well said.&amp;nbsp; In fact, this song reminds me of him and his older brother, as well.&amp;nbsp; Listened to it while I was on a campout with the latter back in 94, I did.&amp;nbsp; I could probably keep rambling about each song on my playlist, but I probably shouldn't.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
On a final note, I finished reading the entire &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517226952/sr=1-3/qid=1153459295/ref=sr_1_3/002-7810838-5088036?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hitchhiker's Trilogy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, so I treated myself to &lt;a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0371724/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;the movie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last night.&amp;nbsp; The first time I saw it, I saw it in the theatre with my wife and a few friends.&amp;nbsp; I had some pretty high expectations for it, since I had read the book quite a few times since I was 13.&amp;nbsp; I walked out terribly disappointed, but unjustly so, because now having seen it a few more times, I realize how brilliantly they infused Douglas' ideas and character into the movie.&amp;nbsp; Strongly recommended.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's all for me, I'm gonna attack one of the boxes of cereal I bought tonight.&amp;nbsp; Always a treat to write, and a honor to be read.&amp;nbsp; Till next time!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>The state needs a bath</title>

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I really wish i had something to write tonight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But i don't. Why can't i just accept it? Because i don't want to, dangit. I'm 'fraid there's a mighty large number of things in life that we have to accept...but not being able to write tonight, well, that takes the taco. Oh, i know what it is, it's the pollution in the valley of the sun. Correction: Valley of the sun hidden behind 15 layers of dirt, smoke and dust. That must be clouding my mind of all things written.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What i wouldn't give for a monsoon storm the size of Alaska. This state needs a bath.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pseudo-lit</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://dop.outsidetheworld.com/rants.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;continuous nagging &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;does&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That's great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It rained today&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Large amounts of torrential downpour, it was...Wife and I decided to go to Tagliani's to get some take out food.&amp;nbsp; I tried to convince her to stay at home while I left, but she would have nothing to do with that.&amp;nbsp; About 2 miles into the journey however, certain events wrought change upon her mind.&amp;nbsp; The rain came down in sheets, I tell you, and I couldn't see anything for the life of it all.&amp;nbsp; First, we have no windshield wipers on the driver's side.&amp;nbsp; Second, the brakes sound....well, they sound possessed.&amp;nbsp; It literally sounds like demons will leap from the depths of the discs and drums, for crying out loud.&amp;nbsp; And I do believe they were wretching by the time we got home.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
It was kind of cute to watch her pray to herself in the passenger seat.&amp;nbsp; I could have said I told you so.&amp;nbsp; Wait a minute, I did!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Some sort of record?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;That second paragraph was huge.&amp;nbsp; Completely unlike me.&amp;nbsp; I never write that large of paragraphs, and if I do, I have the insatiable compulsion to hack it up into pieces.&amp;nbsp; Doesn't make sense?&amp;nbsp; Doesn't matter!&amp;nbsp; All for the sake of aesthetics, mind you.&amp;nbsp; All in the name of pseudo-lit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Passion&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I remembered.&amp;nbsp; I mentioned yesterday briefly that I would write a bit about this movie.&amp;nbsp; While I haven't seen it, I feel some sort of responsibility to explain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And don't assume that I won't attend.&amp;nbsp; I was waiting for something to happen before I gave myself time to ponder this film.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to see if a certain writer/critic/believer would say something about it, since he seems to have a great deal to discuss about everything else.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-29-1.html"&gt;And I got my wish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For those of you not familiar with Orson Scott Card, you definitely should.&amp;nbsp; He's a remarkable thinker with a keen mind for culture and society.&amp;nbsp; He has enough similarities to smaller folk to make him approachable, yet he possesses the intellect to request a certain amount of respect.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
In the aforementioned article, he strips his essay into three distinct parts:&amp;nbsp; His views as a film critic, a believer, and an American.&amp;nbsp; It's not sappy in any way, and it really provides a three dimensional aspect to his opinion.&amp;nbsp; Because that's all that it is, beautiful opinion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I was left to myself after reading the article, albeit none the closer to my goal of deciding whether to see this movie.&amp;nbsp; I like to make decisions for myself, but for this one, it seems a bit more thought and influence outside of my body is needed.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I think too much.&amp;nbsp; I assume you're thinking the same exact thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New Links&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's been a long week, and I'm happy to see two of my good friends begin writing again.&amp;nbsp; If you haven't taken a look at the links to the right, go ahead and check them out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://dop.outsidetheworld.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Difference of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the fine creation of my friend Eric, who is a Computer Science major.&amp;nbsp; Hence, the binary code as the back drop.&amp;nbsp; His rants are continually choice, and I'm glad they're back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tech-desk.net/thoughts.htm"&gt;Heg's Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is my friend Peter's site.&amp;nbsp; His writings are fewer and further between, but they are often more poignant and subtle.&amp;nbsp; Definitely worth a gander as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I deserve a break.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for the visits, it's always appreciated and this whole project will be back on Monday.&amp;nbsp; Until then.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

For my part, I can imagine staring upward at the kaleidoscopic sky for the rest of my life; or at least for as long as my legs will propel me up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A new week</title>
    <content type='html'>Ahem, a new week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This weekend was enjoyable, I must say. &amp;nbsp;Wife and I got to spend some time with a few friends of ours. &amp;nbsp;We ate at their place and then headed to Mesa to view the Mesa Arizona temple lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was beautiful, as it always is. &amp;nbsp;However this year, there seemed to be a few more lights around than usual. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I was going to place a picture of the lights here on the site, but with my poor camera phone, it made the Christmas lights appear as if they were fire, and every tree around the temple grounds was engulfed in flames.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you peruse the site this week, you'll be happy to note that the Media page has finally been updated. &amp;nbsp; Go visit when you have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a few pictures there, one poor song, and the hope of a lot more content in the coming month. &amp;nbsp;Please, please keep in mind one thing: &amp;nbsp;I don't know too much about photography, I simply like taking pictures of random scenery too much. &amp;nbsp;It'll get better, I promise. &amp;nbsp;I haven't had a decent camera in ages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also changed the front page picture, but I'm still trying to get used to it. &amp;nbsp;Maybe I was just too attached to the other one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No shopping trips this weekend, though. &amp;nbsp;No money this time around. &amp;nbsp;We'll hit the stores as soon as Friday rolls around. &amp;nbsp;Oh, that reminds me. &amp;nbsp;We have a train around our tree now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwxsMvnWfbwZvkCcf1Z-s04o4mgjqwrDGUwC43voWzS8mSYCGcgHhC9dX-3GFs0qfCvQnH2JBkA9V2sFcXUD8_pI6lrakSO0bX-ZJApgR-x9_-swJQbtDeUbcNryzM3hZdtca1/s1600/6974068613.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwxsMvnWfbwZvkCcf1Z-s04o4mgjqwrDGUwC43voWzS8mSYCGcgHhC9dX-3GFs0qfCvQnH2JBkA9V2sFcXUD8_pI6lrakSO0bX-ZJApgR-x9_-swJQbtDeUbcNryzM3hZdtca1/s1600/6974068613.jpg" height="261" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There you go, have a fuzzy picture, compliments of Sanyo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's one of the greatest things to have during the holidays. &amp;nbsp;I highly recommend it. &amp;nbsp;In fact, if you don't have one, start a fund, go shopping, look around, go nuts. &amp;nbsp;Just make sure yours doesn't play a high-pitched "Christmas Favourite" as the box mentioned. &amp;nbsp;Yeah, that's how the manufacturer spelled favorite. &amp;nbsp;They must correlate Christmas time with Merry Olde England. &amp;nbsp;And who doesn't? &amp;nbsp;Disney sure does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that's it. &amp;nbsp;No more for today, says I. &amp;nbsp;Have a great week, we'll see you tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yes, you know what tomorrow is.</content>

I thought we still had a little time. Even though I said it was okay to go, I held onto a spark of hope that I could squeeze your hand one last time on earth. Oh, how I wish the flight had been a little earlier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The past few months have been heart-achingly gut-wrenching. I'm so sorry I took you out of your house. I'm sorry you declined so rapidly. I'm sorry Tyler passed away and you couldn't attend his service. &amp;nbsp;I know you loved him dearly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I kept thinking you could get better, if only this or that could happen. I called upon the powers of heaven to help you. But even with all the powers of heaven and earth, the inevitable cannot be forestalled. It was your time to return to your Father in Heaven.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Looking back, we see how truly inevitable it was. There were too many obstacles, and far too few miracles. In the moment, though, we held onto faith. In the very hour of your suffering, we pleaded for progress.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But my dear mom, miracles were present. The veil between heaven and earth was parted, and we received help, knowledge, and guidance as we held your hand on your journey to the next step.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We both know our relationship had its strains. We both know the anxieties of our souls kept us at odds more often than we bonded as mother and son. But I deeply admire the tenacity you showed time and again as you relentlessly cared for me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I carry that with me, Mom. I have seven children under my care who need me, and I learned from you how to love and protect them. Sometimes, bewilderment overcomes me as I look in the mirror at my 45-year-old eyes and wonder how I was so blessed to have the life I do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was because of your choices. All of them. Good, bad, right, or wrong. You beat yourself up so often about the decisions you made. But now, free of the physical pains and limitations that beset you during this mortal life, perhaps you can see, holistically and impartially, how well you did. Perhaps your anxiety and depression can fade away, leaving only the strength that pushed you forward each time those illnesses overcame you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll always remember our drive to Utah with Heather. I'll cherish taking you to McDonald's and feeding you French fries in the car, tearing open the ketchup packet and squeezing a tiny bit on each fry. I told you that's how Sadie did it, and it made you laugh. I loved your gratitude for each bite. It still makes me tear up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There's so much more I could tell you, Mom, but for now, my last note pertains to my son.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will never, ever understand how grateful I am for the care you showed Sumner from the day he was born. We were so young and had him early in life. We were still in school and navigating a new marriage, lacking the experience we needed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank God you were there to help us. You helped raise him into the kind, intelligent 20-year-old he is today, a man who cherishes his family and looks out for others. I don't know how our lives would have turned out without you during that time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I just want peace for you, Mom. I hope your dad was there at the end, helping you cross the bridge into the afterlife. I hope he was everything you remembered him to be. And I hope that when you saw your mom, you gave her the biggest hug. She loves you so much, just like you loved me. That's how I know. That's the funny thing about our family.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The good and the bad, they all add up. They all use the same language of love. Your whole life was a testament to love. You spoke it in the only way you knew how, and while I didn't always understand your words, I now see the love woven into your actions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, at the end of all things, I understand you a little better. And because of that, life can be a little sweeter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Until we see each other again, Mom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sun, Moon, and Stars, all under the same great sky.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Tuesdays</title>

&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I never could get used to Tuesdays...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Tuesday must be the red-headed step child of the week. And, come to think of it, February very well could be the same in relation to the months of the year. Perhaps this is why i'm having a bit of difficulty grasping a hold of this time of my life. I had to head home from work early again today. Apparently none of the food which i had partaken of in the past day wanted to stick around any longer. So it proceeded to push and shove its blessed little way out the way it came. Poor food. My tummy (gut? stomach?) must not have been a very hospitable host today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm in the process of finding a good host for my new website...coming in the next couple of months. If any of you all have any suggestions in regards to which host would do dandy for my website, just let me know. I have a few really cool ideas for the site, and i'd like to make it a little more interactive. I would really like to steer clear of any ads and keep it as simple as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Someone must be home...the light's on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title> The Blog Goes Green</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It was a busy weekend.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;As I mentioned in the daily blog, I had no desire to get back on the computer after Friday night, which is a rare thing for me.&amp;nbsp; Usual weekends involve me plastered to my desk for hours each night, pounding out words and redesigning the site.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
So why the change of heart this weekend?&amp;nbsp; In a fit of redesign rage Friday night, I looked up at the top of this very page often, frowning each time at the volume of white space.&amp;nbsp; I wanted something different!&amp;nbsp; I wanted flash animation!&amp;nbsp; I had no idea how to do this!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Off I went to Adobe.com, searching for tips and tricks to implement a custom-drawn animation into my site.&amp;nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, I gave up and simply downloaded the entire 400 Mb trial version of Flash CS3 Professional.&amp;nbsp; I figured I could learn it as I went along, kind of like I did with Photoshop.&amp;nbsp; While I did take a class to learn Photoshop, the only real thing I paid attention to was how to make water effects with the "ripple" tool.&amp;nbsp; That hasn't come in too handy, except for entertaining Sumner.&amp;nbsp; And I should add that's losing it's luster quick too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Back to Flash.&amp;nbsp; I installed the program (nearly 10 minutes, a new record) and opened it up.&amp;nbsp; Nothing looked familiar, so I poked around the menu settings and decided to start from a template.&amp;nbsp; Templates have historically been a great place to start learning programs risk-free, but the problem here was that every template was for a banner ad.&amp;nbsp; That wasn't really what I had in mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I kept at it for another two hours or so and let me make no pretense; I was extremely frustrated.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea why I expected to pick it up and learn it without some sort of effort, and the program made me pay dearly.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the night I was fed up with everything computer related, and I shut the computer off.&amp;nbsp; Done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Saturday morning brought a &lt;/b&gt;welcomed phone call from the in-laws; this can only mean one thing on a weekend.&amp;nbsp; Breakfast!&amp;nbsp; We don't do it often, but when the occasion arises, the wife and I always recommend &lt;a href="http://www.crackerbarrel.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Cracker Barrel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as our choice of restaurant.&amp;nbsp; They never disappoint with their selection of morning delicacies, but we could never convince them to go.&amp;nbsp; I suppose they had a valid reason, as the nearest location was situated somewhere down the I-10 in Tempe, nearly 20 miles from our location.&amp;nbsp; As a side note, I would whole-heartedly drive the distance if it meant being spared from such tortuous devices as Denny's and *shudder* McDonalds.&amp;nbsp; I used to like their breakfast food, but then I grew taste buds and moved on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
The fortuitous occasion arrived a few months ago that a Cracker Barrel was built just five miles away from the in-law's house, nestled right next to &lt;a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CFPage?appID=94&amp;amp;CMID=&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;pageView=image&amp;amp;catalogId=10001&amp;amp;partNumber=&amp;amp;storeID=55&amp;amp;storeId=10151&amp;amp;deptId=000000000&amp;amp;categoryId=000000000&amp;amp;jumpToPage=1&amp;amp;currentPage=0&amp;amp;subdeptId=000000000"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;the largest outdoor outfitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that I have ever seen.&amp;nbsp; I think they may have an indoor outdoor inside that building, if you follow.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, I can't digest the idea that the entirety is covered with merchandise.&amp;nbsp; The edifice is simply too big.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I don't remember where I was going with this.&amp;nbsp; Oh yes, Cracker Barrel.&amp;nbsp; I had the most delicious selection on the menu, Mama's French Toast Breakfast with turkey sausage (&lt;b&gt;sausage&lt;/b&gt;! shout out to Janey) and scrambled eggs.&amp;nbsp; I highly recommend it.&amp;nbsp; The wife got her usual, a mountainous bowl of oatmeal and a muffin the size of a bowling ball.&amp;nbsp; She can hardly put a dent in the muffin, but Sumner likes to eat the rest anyway.&amp;nbsp; It all works out when you have a three year old with a voracious appetite.&amp;nbsp; No kidding, that child can pack it in when he wants to.&amp;nbsp; When he doesn't want to, well...good luck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6jqAa9ECmA5PeHpTLf55cflcTdaFi3xb-i39RClSG50ZS-3tE2ogZhCFdllvT0EaC3iW_h5tpNhEERXCfNMqD6sutEfZqqydEtfedi8RcKDhW8aaWfjFUaAqhxTgLvlZ_SjcP/s1600/IMG_0941.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6jqAa9ECmA5PeHpTLf55cflcTdaFi3xb-i39RClSG50ZS-3tE2ogZhCFdllvT0EaC3iW_h5tpNhEERXCfNMqD6sutEfZqqydEtfedi8RcKDhW8aaWfjFUaAqhxTgLvlZ_SjcP/s1600/IMG_0941.JPG" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;After breakfast, we parted &lt;/b&gt;ways with the in-laws and headed back toward our side of East freakin' Mesa, and I remembered that we had surpassed our oil change reminder by several...*ahem*...months.&amp;nbsp; It was decided that it would probably be a good idea to head over to the dealership.&amp;nbsp; The brakes were shot on both vehicles, and the wife's car made Bozo the Clown noises whenever you turned it on.&amp;nbsp; The past few times we had taken the car to the local mechanic, they being the cheaper of others in town and a place we had trusted on multiple occasions.&amp;nbsp; Yet the last time, I was left unimpressed by their brash service.&amp;nbsp; It was time to go Honda, baby.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And that's where it happened.&amp;nbsp; Presented by repair and maintenance bills that stretched the length of 8.5x11, we thought twice about our future relationship with not one, but both cars.&amp;nbsp; You might call it an impulse; heck, you could even call it a rash decision, but we made friends with two particular cars on the lot that decided to follow us home that night.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/pics/IMG_0941.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
After spending eight hours at the dealership.&amp;nbsp; Eight. Freaking. Hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And yes, we like 'em.&amp;nbsp; Nah, we love 'em.&amp;nbsp; We got two Honda Fits, their newest car that promise good gas mileage and low emissions. (you wondered why the Blog went green?&amp;nbsp; Now you know)&amp;nbsp; They drive swell.&amp;nbsp; And hey, it's the wife's first new car!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Good news all around.&amp;nbsp; We should save a small fortune on gas during the next few years.&amp;nbsp; That fact played no small role in our decision to make the trade.&amp;nbsp; They're good looking too for such small cars.&amp;nbsp; Pretty functional too, I was amazed at the flexibility of the cabin.&amp;nbsp; Plenty of room for kids in the back seat, too.&amp;nbsp; All for the price of one inexpensive SUV!&amp;nbsp; And we got two of them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Yeah, I'm a bit sad to see the Acura go.&amp;nbsp; Sumner actually asked later that night when we thought the old cars would get back from the hospital (it was the only analogy that fit, really) and I told him that they probably weren't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
The Acura was still a pretty good car, but the mileage jumped up really quick and I had already had the air conditioner and transmission worked on recently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I don't even want to know what'll happen to the wife's Bozo car.&amp;nbsp; I was worried every day that she drove that thing to work.&amp;nbsp; Darn thing shook so much she swore it'd blow and leave an Olympic-sized crater in the freeway.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My dad told me at least a billion times to stop exaggerating, but I ain't kidding you.&amp;nbsp; One shaky car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
The picture ain't great, but the red one is mine, the white one is hers.&amp;nbsp; Cut the picture in half and you'll have a whole car!&amp;nbsp; I wanted to roll them out of the garage, but that would have meant opening up the door and possibly waking up the boy from his slumber. I'll take a few pictures later on down the road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So that was Saturday, &lt;/b&gt;and you should now be gathering a pretty good idea of why no posts were made throughout the weekend.&amp;nbsp; We came home pooped that night and slept soundly as can be.&amp;nbsp; Sunday was spent in the company of family visiting from Utah, and that was really nice.&amp;nbsp; We were still pert tired from the previous day's activities, so we needed a break.&amp;nbsp; Oh yes, and the wife fell into the pool.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Actually, Sumner pushed her in.&amp;nbsp; It was quite humorous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
My mother provided her with dry clothes from the bottom of Where's Waldo's 1990's chest of drawers, so she looked extra nice on the ride home.&amp;nbsp; She asked if I thought people could see her through the windows, and I said no.&amp;nbsp; Though I kept wondering why so many people were pointing and shouting, "There he is!&amp;nbsp; I see him!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Phew.&amp;nbsp; I think that's a generous enough entry for the time being.&amp;nbsp; Time to hit the hay.&amp;nbsp; See you over at the &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Moblah'g! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;You know how to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Mondays</title>
    <content type='html'>Mondays tend to throw the world at you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All at once, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I woke up without the least bit of expectation for the day. Typical Monday, having stayed up again too late on the previous Sunday, hoping that my wife would wake up and join me in the Living room. No luck. So I awoke with that whole body yawn. Mind numbing yawn, it was. A yawn that didn't expect the woes of Monday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's never a good thing to find out that you haven't any health insurance, especially if you and your employer have spent a small fortune on it. Many phone calls later, you find out the root cause: Human error. You try to get mad, but you simply can't, because you find the same vulnerability in your mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of the day was spent playing catch up; 400 e-mails to complete. See, last week, we played hero to the Eastern seaboard. All the while, we didn't realize that our own e-mails were locked in cyberspace, piling up until Merlin turned the key.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(twist) 60 messages, 70, 190, 340, 500. Down they fell! Expulsion from cyber-limbo!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now the day winds down, the summer has finally cooled down enough for the windows to open in the evening. It finally smells like Autumn in my home now. Summer simply smells like one thing. And that one thing is whatever your air conditioner filter smells like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love Autumn time. You'll probably find a Halloween theme taking over a small section of this site soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that's it, for now. Besides, my cat's going crazy. Goodnight.</content>

    <title>Santa's Pipe</title>
    <content type='html'>Finally, Friday is upon us. &amp;nbsp; It's unique signature is visible upon the week's horizon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week, I have provided you with a different snapshot every day. &amp;nbsp;Well, I don't have a new one today. &amp;nbsp;I just couldn't muster it. &amp;nbsp;So instead, I have delved into my treasure chest of old pictures to give you this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtuZApDZySyqgRPDhzS7Mn8TWfqGnIziiRBiwWodAu-KHwdu5_lsATehiuWD-BSrJCbrTI7vY1liLhEVyJdVbtIWpEq1E_fSA9pPF9RLzfsfIYLaCVBzVBJ_09-gLtUk_eyGl1/s1600/santa2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtuZApDZySyqgRPDhzS7Mn8TWfqGnIziiRBiwWodAu-KHwdu5_lsATehiuWD-BSrJCbrTI7vY1liLhEVyJdVbtIWpEq1E_fSA9pPF9RLzfsfIYLaCVBzVBJ_09-gLtUk_eyGl1/s1600/santa2.jpg" height="320" width="203" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got this a couple of years ago from my elder brother. &amp;nbsp;He usually had this threatening picture of Saint Nick up on his refrigerator door, and he had some sort of clever caption, written by himself, affixed somewhere nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yes, I believe it went something like, "Only good little girls and boys get to know what's in Santa's pipe".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, it's paraphrased, anyway. &amp;nbsp;I'm sure my brother will write me tomorrow and let me know what it really said. &amp;nbsp;And now, it's made its way on the the old Net. &amp;nbsp;What do you think about that, eh?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, this week was my gift to you. &amp;nbsp;And now, it's at an end. &amp;nbsp;Sorry about the short entry today. It's been a long day, after all. &amp;nbsp;Have a great weekend, and I'll see you back here on Monday. (or Sunday night, for all you blogjumpers out there)</content>

I&amp;#39;ve always been fascinated by these creatures. They seem so gentle and, dare I say, intelligent. He looked at me quizzically for quite a while before taking advantage of his new vista; before long, the kids found me and were begging to hold him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;I set him back down inside my garden, silently hoping he would stay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken with the wife&amp;#39;s iPhone 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited in Snapseed.</content>

    <title>There's a first time for everything</title>
    <content type='html'>I pulled out of the driveway this morning, on time and ready to go to work.  Not 15 feet and my car sputtered to a stop.  &lt;p&gt;It was the first time I had ever run out of gas!  Oh well, lesson learned. &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>New job</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Tomorrow i start my new job...&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
By a show of hands, how many people hate the feeling of the first day on the job? I know i don't really care for it. Honestly, it doesn't matter to me how prepared i am, how focused and intent i make myself on creating a good impression, i will invariably feel a little out of sorts that first day. I am starting my long-awaited job at Cox Communications tomorrow, where i will be doing what they call E-Care...i will be handling customer service and techical issues for clients of Cox. The great thing about the job is that i get to do all of this by email...and i can avoid the phones a lot of the time. So, all of you who think that they can now call me directly to solve all of your cable woes, sorry charlie...this cat don't play that way. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For the past couple of months, i have delved into the world of computer upgrades and services on the side. Not a bad little rap, i suppose, i have had a lot of success but haven't made a bit of money. I seem to have this problem with charging people for things that seem a little fun to me, i suppose. So if anyone needs their computers networked, upgraded, or repaired, let me know. I will try my hardest to let you pay me.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I have also purchased a new scooter, it's one of the funnest things i have ever owned in my life. I use it mainly to get around the neighborhood, and i will use it eventually to get to work. I am trying to sell my car, so if anybody that you know is interested in purchasing, point them to my car's webpage &lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;. It's a great car.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, that's about it for now. I'm going to go ride my scooter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Happy trees</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I only have &lt;/b&gt;one thing to say about this, really.&amp;nbsp; Heck Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Bob Ross painting on the Revolution?!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.revolutionfanboy.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Revolution Fanboy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the site indicates there is "a&amp;nbsp;press release&amp;nbsp;on the official Bob Ross (R.I.P.) website stating a game based on Bob Ross' teachings is to hit the Revolution."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Further, the game will "utilize the unique inputs that the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Revolution have that can truly immerse the players while they learn to paint like Bob Ross and can play the addictive and fun games that we have planned for the title. "&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
In all likelihood, this article must have something to do with today's date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Think Happy Trees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I have found website which offer to dramatically increase traffic to your site http://cheap-mass-backlinks.com they claim they managed to get close to 4000 visitors/day using their services you could also get lot more targeted traffic from search engines as you have now. I used their services and got significantly more visitors to my blog. Hope this helps :) They offer best &lt;a href="http://cheap-mass-backlinks.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;services to increase website traffic&lt;/a&gt;  Take care. Richard</content>

    <title>Lake Arrowhead, revisited</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A brief hiatus &lt;/b&gt;from the blog, but I come back with content.&amp;nbsp; Actually, I'll confess a bit of writer's block that affects me even now.&amp;nbsp; I know the only way to overcome this pitfall is to keep writing...so if the quality suffers as I go along here, my apologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As I wrote last week, the family and I took a trip to Lake Arrowhead over the weekend.&amp;nbsp; We didn't stay for very long, I'm sad to say.&amp;nbsp; Not nearly long enough.&amp;nbsp; The weather was obscenely beautiful with the temperatures never gracing the 90 degree platform.&amp;nbsp; There was nary a cloud in the satiny blue sky.&amp;nbsp; To leave Arizona during the hottest month was the best part about it all, though it left a fog over our mind when we thought about going back home.&amp;nbsp; Here, just see for yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirprhGSxC534iOOGCaZSbTw4N6zw7xiywjrgPotaF5V2vNkuMLaJS2041QEKrB-kd0xuv4wnmA-xVsdYE5GFRGMPFGsLh_LhVi3q7-HlweafCjSI-YfKpkPoWrrlVEYzdhQTLE/s1600/IMG_1017.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirprhGSxC534iOOGCaZSbTw4N6zw7xiywjrgPotaF5V2vNkuMLaJS2041QEKrB-kd0xuv4wnmA-xVsdYE5GFRGMPFGsLh_LhVi3q7-HlweafCjSI-YfKpkPoWrrlVEYzdhQTLE/s1600/IMG_1017.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Does it get much better than that? This was Saturday, our day at Lake Gregory.&amp;nbsp; It's not too far away from the town of Lake Arrowhead, and kids prefer it as a destination, owing to the water slides and all.&amp;nbsp; If you look close in the next picture, you can see it winding down through the trees.&amp;nbsp; If only I had a better trained eye for this type of thing, the slide would be the focus of the picture, rather that...well, nothing in particular.&amp;nbsp; Maybe that big tree in the middle.&amp;nbsp; Which looks like it belongs in Rockefeller Center.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgK0GHiHVzeTcRuVJ17C45dmicJnxdBRZJaYjVehOSiEZDun-Btq0D9AoiC-pHaBuZbqFswiYFx4VVlVhDF6f-tqr4wbISQhwjwabxDrzv4UpT07iiLe4WU9psCMaL2axyq22Zx/s1600/IMG_1030.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgK0GHiHVzeTcRuVJ17C45dmicJnxdBRZJaYjVehOSiEZDun-Btq0D9AoiC-pHaBuZbqFswiYFx4VVlVhDF6f-tqr4wbISQhwjwabxDrzv4UpT07iiLe4WU9psCMaL2axyq22Zx/s1600/IMG_1030.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's quite sad...I'm looking through the photos I took, and it's bare indeed.&amp;nbsp; I hardly took time to snap anything.&amp;nbsp; What can I say, I was too busy not doing anything in particular.&amp;nbsp; Not something I get to do very often.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
When Sumner ran up to the lake, he had two very important questions for us.&amp;nbsp; Why was there sand in the pool?&amp;nbsp; Where is the blue water?&amp;nbsp; He wanted blue water, if possible.&amp;nbsp; He even said please and thank you.&amp;nbsp; But that didn't stop him from diving right in.&amp;nbsp; And let me tell you, it was cold water.&amp;nbsp; Dad didn't even go in past his ankles.&amp;nbsp; What a bum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We stayed in Lake Arrowhead until &lt;/b&gt;about 4:00pm on Sunday.&amp;nbsp; More often than not, we leave in the early morning hours, but this time we just couldn't pull ourselves away from the scene.&amp;nbsp; We played pool, read, played more pool, read again, ate, sat out on the deck, and read some more.&amp;nbsp; I finished Harry Potter #6 on the way home.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-way-home.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wait, I feel redundant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;I digress.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
I saw some interesting mountains a ways off in the distance as we were traveling home on the I-10 that evening, and it made me realize again just how beautiful and varied Arizona is.&amp;nbsp; I'll probably never even see a tenth of the things this state has to offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
Sorry about the fuzziness of the pictures, it was getting dark and we were traveling at 80 mph, after all.&amp;nbsp; But you'll get the idea.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;b&gt;That cold that I mentioned last week &lt;/b&gt;is still with me.&amp;nbsp; I can't stop coughing and it's becoming annoying.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I ought to take better care of myself, and I thought I was over this bout until the cool mountain air entered my lungs late Thursday night.&amp;nbsp; I woke up feeling it Friday morning, and I'm having the hardest time shaking it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
See, I told you i'd wander all over this blog.&amp;nbsp; A million apologies.&amp;nbsp; I'm going to end it there, if you don't mind.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy the pictures, and be sure to head on over the the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blogspot.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;when you have the opportunity.&amp;nbsp; Always something going on there, for certain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Training</title>
    <content type='html'>The total is now 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of you have asked me if i'm done with training, or whether i have more classes yet to assimilate into my collective conscious. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The answer is yes. &amp;nbsp;You'll have to decide what question i just answered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life has been going extremely well as of late. &amp;nbsp;My friend Sven got home from his mission in Bulgaria last week and has adjusted pretty well to American life again. &amp;nbsp;On Sunday evening, his family opened their house to family and friends for a bit of food and fun. &amp;nbsp;I couldn't believe how many people i saw that night that i hadn't seen in years. &amp;nbsp;It was a great time to reflect on where i had come from in my life, and who had made me who i am today. &amp;nbsp;And as far as the job goes, i couldn't really ask for a better company to work for...if i could only get out to the floor and work now. &amp;nbsp;The next two weeks will be dedicated to a sort of "Gateway" into the technical environment, where i and two others will be assigned a mentor and given the chance to take calls. &amp;nbsp;Excited, am i.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This afternoon in class, my trainer said something that struck me as generally profound. &amp;nbsp;He stated, "One should always move forward. Even if that involves turning around and heading in the direction you came." &amp;nbsp;It makes sense to me. &amp;nbsp;I don't know what his premise was in mentioning that to the class, by now i'm sure that he realizes that i have the attention span of a A.D.D. chimp with 15 televisions laid in front of him. &amp;nbsp;It just goes to show that truth is everywhere, you just have to have your ears open and your mind in tune with what is going on around you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sincerest apologies for the short entry today. &amp;nbsp;Somehow i'll make it up...i'm still waiting for suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a great weekend.</content>

    <title>Shoes</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It was an &lt;/b&gt;interesting weekend, and a quick one at that.&amp;nbsp; After work on Friday, Jenna, Sumner and I scooted off to Scottsdale rather quickly to attend my cousin's birthday dinner at a restaurant called Tucci's.&amp;nbsp; More about that particular dining establishment later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I hadn't seen this particular cousin since July of 2003, shortly after I married.&amp;nbsp; She's now 21 years old, and it's just another one of those "How old am I?" moments in life.&amp;nbsp; She's a good gal, and it was certainly good to see her and her parentals.&amp;nbsp; She was quite glad to find out that I had a &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/enderwiggn"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;MySpace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I was not surprised that she had one.&amp;nbsp; At all.&amp;nbsp; She fits the demographic, I believe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And yes, I know there are a few of you out there (the ones that didn't come here straight from MySpace) that are staring at your monitor, cursing my name for selling my soul to the MySpace regime.&amp;nbsp; No worries, mates.&amp;nbsp; I do it for several reasons:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
1.&amp;nbsp; I've actually found a few people that I wanted to find&lt;br /&gt;
2.&amp;nbsp; It lets people know that I have a predilection for blogs&lt;br /&gt;
3.&amp;nbsp; Jenna has one, so why can't I?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The restaurant.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Pizza joints are a dime/dozen.&amp;nbsp; Good pizza joints are much, much rarer.&amp;nbsp; So when we strolled up to Tucci's and saw the typical advertisements regarding their authenticity, I was skeptical at best.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I guess that's the good thing about keeping your guard up, though.&amp;nbsp; A pleasant surprise can turn into a refreshing experience.&amp;nbsp; This pizza was good.&amp;nbsp; They seemed to care about the two most important pieces to the puzzle: the bread and the sauce.&amp;nbsp; You get either one of those wrong, and you have a bad pie.&amp;nbsp; You get both of those wrong, and I'm counting the days until the place closes down.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Saturday, we cleaned.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I mean, we CLEANED.&amp;nbsp; From the baseboards to the corners of the closets, nothing avoided our sanitizing stare.&amp;nbsp; The master closet bore the brunt of our efforts, as that was the worst location in the home.&amp;nbsp; We ended up with eight full bags of clothes to hand away.&amp;nbsp; The only way this fit in there before was because the clothes were crammed in there so tightly.&amp;nbsp; Tetris would have been jealous.&amp;nbsp; (Lame, lame sentence.&amp;nbsp; I know.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And of course, I took every last shirt to the cleaners.&amp;nbsp; Time to look presentable at work again, I presume.&amp;nbsp; But when every shirt that you own is at the cleaners, it makes it insurmountably difficult to go to church the next day.&amp;nbsp; I didn't think about this until I tried getting ready.&amp;nbsp; Ho, hum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We also saw &lt;/b&gt;the movie "Click" on Saturday night.&amp;nbsp; Typical Adam Sandler movie, mind you, with plenty of cursing, dogs humping stuffed animals, and the now common uncomfortable crying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Crying?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We went as a group of three couples, and all three girls were bawling by the end of the movie.&amp;nbsp; I don't mind them crying at all, but it just seems so out of place to start crying after hearing Mr. Sandler say "What?&amp;nbsp; Your dad's stereo BLOWS?" a few times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That about sums up the weekend.&amp;nbsp; I'll leave you with a few pictures of Sumner, and bid you adieu for a week.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWyAsj_5Z9beULBKIDuoS1Amu4ep-rJ5Q2fedWvRTB8dqH-YuJXCzbT6TGrTIrkZ5FMAsnfiS5q9JjOZCWztu0xq8h6nM6QDpPOSgTKxY0diJ7MsmwrdFEPu0LrLs3TgNFjz23/s1600/IMG_0347.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWyAsj_5Z9beULBKIDuoS1Amu4ep-rJ5Q2fedWvRTB8dqH-YuJXCzbT6TGrTIrkZ5FMAsnfiS5q9JjOZCWztu0xq8h6nM6QDpPOSgTKxY0diJ7MsmwrdFEPu0LrLs3TgNFjz23/s1600/IMG_0347.JPG" height="241" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
Have I ever told you Sumner loved shoes?&amp;nbsp; He also loves the shoe box.&amp;nbsp; Sorry for the choppy video. (click picture for movie, 3mb WMV file)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Perhaps then, that friend of a friend decided to bring back the world&amp;#39;s greatest cane. &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, your friend suggests this cane be on Hipstaproject.  He then names the cane after an anime character from Vampire Knight. &lt;p&gt;Smiles and happiness abound in great measure. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Watts&lt;br&gt;Film: Pistil</content>

    <title>Cat in the Hat</title>
    <content type='html'>My apologies! &amp;nbsp;Welcome to the "lunch time" edition of the Blog. &amp;nbsp;Special note: &amp;nbsp;You will find no great entertainment here today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I simply knew that I needed to write today. &amp;nbsp;There isn't anything in specific that needs to be written, but this is simply just in case there are any of those out there that check this blog after the weekend is over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wife and I saw the Cat in the Hat movie this weekend, or should I say, the Crap in the Sack movie. &amp;nbsp;Big pile of flaming Crap in the Sack. &amp;nbsp;It was terrible. &amp;nbsp;That's the only way to describe it, really...it was terrible. &amp;nbsp;Every time the Cat (aka Mike Myers) opened his mouth, my mind was sent into reparatory prayer. &amp;nbsp;Please, please make him stop talking. &amp;nbsp;Please....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so on. &amp;nbsp;Sure, there were a few funny moments, but I can drivel out a few laughs of my own on this blog. &amp;nbsp;And they don't cost a dime!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Free laughs! &amp;nbsp;Now at the Blog!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, that was the weekend summed up in one bad movie. &amp;nbsp;Only one other thing of note, last night I had the strangest dream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were two ingredients to this dream: &amp;nbsp;A dog and a crab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cross these two items together and you get a very disturbing hairy sea creature. &amp;nbsp;In my dream, I went to my friends house to talk to them. &amp;nbsp;Out of the corner of my eye, I spied a strange looking object.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Oh, never mind that. &amp;nbsp;That's just my dog", said my friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I walked over to it, naturally, and found the greatest offense against nature. &amp;nbsp;It had the body of a dog, the claws of a crab, and it was sunk low to the ground with little crab feet. &amp;nbsp;And it was hairy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, don't know where I'm going with that. &amp;nbsp;Now, time to call the wife. &amp;nbsp;See you on Tuesday!</content>

    <title>Secret song</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not too much to say today, I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; I went to bed relatively early last night, so no entry was written.&amp;nbsp; I can definitely say that's a good thing, because anything written last night would have been poor, poor material.&amp;nbsp; No promises for today, though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As it's St. Patrick's Day, I've decorated the Blog site and have worn a green shirt.&amp;nbsp; That's the extent of my celebration.&amp;nbsp; When I was younger, my father would put green food coloring in the milk and pancake batter for breakfast.&amp;nbsp; I seem to remember that my mom was never a big fan of that...but who would be a fan of green milk?&amp;nbsp; Nobody but an eight year old kid, that's who.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemailahundred.html"&gt;Did you know that the Cheat was hatched from a fish-stick filled egg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Does that mean that The Cheat is classified in the same family as say, the Platypuses and echidnas?&amp;nbsp; Excepting of course that none of their eggs are crammed full of fish sticks.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps one day soon, we'll be introduced to a little more background on this small yellow mystery...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A good friend of &lt;/b&gt;mine paid visit last night.&amp;nbsp; It's that time of year for spring break visits, and it's always nice to have old friends stop by.&amp;nbsp; There wasn't too much time for fooling around, we went to the nearby 7 Eleven store to pick up some Slurpees and then took off for his house.&amp;nbsp; (Side note:&amp;nbsp; Slurpees are great.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
During the car ride to his house, we listened to Strong Bad's CD.&amp;nbsp; I confess right now, when he asked me if I had listened to it, I said yes. However, I had not.&amp;nbsp; Why did I lie?&amp;nbsp; Because it seemed that I ought to have listened to it, this friend and I used to experience these types of things in tandem.&amp;nbsp; So, by admitting that I hadn't yet heard it was confessing that I wasn't up with it...I would be declaring my separation from all things singular.&amp;nbsp; Well, as this friend reads my entries oft, he now knows the truth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
But, we both were able to sing our silly heads off on the way, and it made me realize how good it is to let your guard down every so often.&amp;nbsp; It takes a special kind of guy to allow you to sing, "The Cheat is NOT DEAD" in front of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
It's work time, so this entry has to be cut short.&amp;nbsp; But, as a special treat today, I give you the lyrics to the "Secretest Song" on the Strong Bad CD!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
As sung by Homestarrunner:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Secret song!&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t believe it’s you!&lt;br /&gt;
I never knew it was true…&lt;br /&gt;
Oh secret song!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secret song, soooooooooong!!&lt;br /&gt;
You’re the secretest song on the album, secret song.&lt;br /&gt;
Songs are made of mysteries.&lt;br /&gt;
And clouds of made of moon beams, secret song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secret song…&lt;br /&gt;
I love you…All night long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t stand to see you go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secret song…I love you so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait….good enough.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Marriage</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Good evening, wherever you are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's been ages since i've written my material...mainly because there was simply too much to catch up on. In a nutshell:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Marriage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was married to a beautiful girl on June 28th, 2003. Remarkable girl, really, and what's more, she puts up with me. Everything. Every last bit. And I love her, and she loves me. What more could you ask for?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm well into year two at work now...and am now schooling my body through life. I attend Ottawa University with my wife, and I've chosen a major. I'll stick with secondary education...which is different than regular education, I suppose. I suppose a lot of things at 12:18 in the morning, really...especially shoddy, flung-together writing. Ho hum.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That'll be it for now, back later. I'll archive my previous stuff for you.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cherry Coke at the airport</title>
    <content type='html'>I brought no pine cones home, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what I did bring back was at least a little bit of sanity. I don't really have too much to say today...I called in sick from work because I felt so lousy. This is the kind of lousy that can only come from riding a scooter to work in the very early morning hours, when the air is so cold and wet you just want to turn right around and go back to bed. But, I keep going because I love how much money I'm saving, and really, winters in Arizona don't last very long, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then you realize Winter time is still a month away. Oh, the joy you feel! But the great news is that I only have to do this until November 9th, when I can start going into work at the decent hour of 8:00am. That way, at least the sun will have made it's efforts of warming the air before I cut through it on my hyper-scooter. (not really, but it sounds quite cool, I think...)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I was up in Utah, my friend Marci and I decided to take a late trip up the canyon in her car. It was raining in the valley, not too bad, but the roads were a little wet. I told myself in my mind that if, upon entering the canyon, I found the roads were still wet or that it was raining in any way, we would turn back. No sense in risking it, right? But all seemed well as we drove closer to the mouth, the roads were dry, and I thought for a minute that I could actually see clear sky. No matter, we continued our course up the road until about 1/4 of the way up. It started to rain a little, but we figured then since we had come so far, why stop now? And rain at the top of the canyon would make it even more beautiful... So. There we were, now half of the way to the summit...and lo and behold, we had fog. Silently, in my mind I knew what was coming next. The air was obviously cold enough for it, but I dared not open my mouth to my traveling companion for fear that she might make me turn my course and head back down the canyon. And about 3/4 of the way up, my thoughts were confirmed to me:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It started snowing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And it wasn't just a little bit of snow, it was a lot of it. Blinding snow, and the windshield wipers weren't working too well either. So, continuing on, my hands gripped the wheel of this little Honda. Oh, and as a side note, this would be the very same Honda that, on one occasion, had careened off the side of the road during a winter snow storm. But she had just put new tires on! 40,000 miles ago. &amp;nbsp;Hmm....better hurry to the top, I said....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We made it without any mishap, and it was surely worth the risk in getting there. The ground had about a half foot of snow, and the trees were glistening under the reflected light of the moon that had just appeared over the crest of the hills. The clouds parted shortly thereafter, and we were left with a beautiful scene of the best nature could possibly offer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And such is life in Utah, if you really choose to live it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Postscript: Don't try to find a Cherry Coke at the Salt Lake Airport. Ever. You'll have walked about 2 miles by the time you give up.</content>

    <title>Anniversary</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Four months!&amp;nbsp; 06/28/03 - 10/28/03!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Happy anniversary, sweetie.&amp;nbsp; I love you! &amp;nbsp;You've made me the happiest man alive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today was much of the same at work, except we decided to help our San Diego because of all of the &lt;a href="http://msnbc.com/news/983543.asp?0cv=CA01"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;fires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I genuinely feel badly for the folks who have lost their homes, but I do not feel an ounce of remorse for those poor souls who complain that they can't have their cable installed because the technician can't drive through a wall of flame.&amp;nbsp; Pity.&amp;nbsp; I felt the same way about those in North Carolina who expected our technicians to drive through the swelling ocean to get to their boat, er, home.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Remember back in 198x, as kids, we would sit in front of the television and watch our wonderful Saturday morning cartoons?&amp;nbsp; Mind you, this was before the era of Japanese animation, so Saturday morning was a little more tolerable.&amp;nbsp; So, during these cartoons, we kids would anticipate the strangest commercials.&amp;nbsp; I had one brought back to me the other day:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Don't drown your food! In mayo or ketchup or goo (yuck!) &lt;br /&gt;
It's no fun to eat what you can't even SEE! So don't drown your food!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Now that I'm an adult, and I'm overly cynical about a few more things, I have to wonder what the purpose of that commercial was.&amp;nbsp; As far as I remember, it was a little potato or scrap of some non-edible drawing, dancing around singing how we shouldn't sauce our vegetables.&amp;nbsp; Hmmmm....I doubt the severity of that particular dilemma of society.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I suppose the FDA or some hoo haw might have seen an epidemic striking the children of America that I didn't see.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps tens of thousands of elementary school children would perform a daily ritual of pouring 96 ounces of Heinz 57 sauce all over their goods each lunch time, crying prayers of sacrifice to the gods of white bread and cheese.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Or, perhaps even more believable, the network execs needed to fill a couple of extra 30 second time slots, and this commercial (and others like it) fulfilled the requirement for educational programming in the mornings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Phew, that was a long drawn out piece about nothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
In other news, Kobe Bryant was a little miffed yesterday about a few of Shaq's comments, which he directed solely at the Wonder Boy. &amp;nbsp;Kobe lashed back by stating,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/985536.asp?0dm=C11US"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"He is not my quote unquote ‘big brother,’ "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; All that I have to say is that Kobe better mind his manners.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps all Mr. Bryant needed back in July was a "big brother" to tell him to keep his hands to himself, and his adultery to a minimum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Poor guy.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow, and hopefully my writing will be more coherent and entertaining.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Jazz got whooped &lt;/b&gt;tonight.&amp;nbsp; I don't recall the score exactly, but it was like 670-36.&amp;nbsp; We went to the game tonight with a couple of our friends, so gratefully that made it worth it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

Adventures at the local Fry's Food and Drug store....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today i had my first solo experience with the "automatic checker machine thingies"** at such stores as K-Mart and the like. I was sent on an errand to purchase Pepto-Bismol for someone at work because, well, because he needed it. I am proud to say that thanks to that fine automated machine i was able to buy the pink ooze in less than 20 seconds. And to my amazement, i found myself giddy afterwards, saying such phrases as, "that was cool" to the local Fry's supervisor. What a nut case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I received an email from my friend Mindy today. She said that one of the phrases that i said in a previous blog was straight out of british play entitled "Rosencrantz and Guilderstern are Dead." Never read it before, but it is now one of my goals to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The door is always open.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
**For lack of a better way to put it, sure why not...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Red and blue lights!</title>
    <content type='html'>Nope, definitely not most people&amp;#39;s favorite things to see while driving to work in the morning, but this ended happily enough.&lt;p&gt;Turns out the officer simply couldn&amp;#39;t see Sumner in the back seat and, well, I was in the carpool lane after all. &lt;p&gt;He bid me farewell with nothing more than a repair slip for my windshield. (which i&amp;#39;ll get fixed soon, honest!)&lt;p&gt;I thought about photoblogging the experience, but then my brain started working again. &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly, on this most anniversary of days.</content>

    <title>In Tucson</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Live, from Tucson, it's saturday night!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I decided to head south this weekend and pay a few friends of mine a much delayed visit. I got into town at about 8:00pm, so it was completely dark and i didn't notice much about the surroundings. But when i woke up and went outside, i saw what makes this city so strange: The mountains. It seems as if they've been placed here out of a joke, strange scragly-pointly-blotchy creations that look so out of place, it couldn't look weirder even if there was lava spewing forth from the peaks. But other than that, it looks and feels a lot like the rest of Arizona, flat, hot, and brown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not much else of substance to write yet today, i suppose that i could say that i might write more tonight, but from all prior experience, we all know that will not happen. I'll be too tired, lazy, or both to do anything. So be that as it may, you have today's entry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Peace and love to all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>Happy New Year, 2004 edition</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Happy New Year, all.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to 2004.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
While I did not plan on writing anything today because of the holiday, I did create something rather blogworthy.&amp;nbsp; Credit needs to be extended to my friend Ryan.&amp;nbsp; He did suggest the musical theme to the video you are about to witness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I call it Round 2.&amp;nbsp; You may call it whatever you wish.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was going to embed this file in the Blog page, but I didn't want it to open automatically when the page was opened.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's a 1.3 megabyte download; so, my apologies to those with slow dial-up connections.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
You can find this video in the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Media page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>25 reasons I love Jenna</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-89" title="photo" src="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/photo-225x300.jpg" alt="photo" width="225" height="300" /&gt;I've been thinking about this post for a while now, and not just because Jenna did the same thing for me on my birthday.  When you're truly in love with a girl, you can't help it; thinking about her is comparable to breathing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, happy birthday, Jenna.  Here's my short list for you.  Even when you're 100, the list will be far too brief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  She is totally and completely kind, generous, and patient. (Ok, so that's three.) An example?  How about her taking care of me?  Surgeries, ER visits, you name it.  Infinite capacity for kindness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  She spends every lunch of hers at home.  Even if it's for 20 minutes, she drives home to see the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.   She is the best mommy in the world.  Every action of hers speaks love.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  She's the only girl I have ever known who can get ready for a date in 15 minutes and look completely, unreasonably, and insanely drop-dead gorgeous.  I don't mean to be superficial, but honestly...have you seen her?  She's beautiful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5.  She has opened herself up to everything that I've found to be beautiful in my life, and has made them 100 times sweeter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6.  She has the most beautiful long, blonde hair.  And she hasn't cut it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7.  She never makes fun of the stupid things I do, like eat a package of Chips Ahoy in one sitting.  That must take restraint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8.  She puts up with me.  Every man who has ever loved a woman should nod in agreement, because we're very despicable creatures sometimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9.  She's a geek like me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10.  We like the same shows.  TV, movies, anything.  She even likes Star Trek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11.  She loves my family.  She loves my mom and my dad, my brothers and sister, and everyone else.  She was excited to meet them, and is always excited to see them again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12.  She's the most accepting person I know.  She'll take you into her heart and trust you as long as you let her.  She understands the miracle of forgiveness, and forgives regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13.  Hard worker?  That's her.  Earned her bachelors when she was 19.  Her masters was at 23.  Could have been earlier, but she met me and, eventually, Sumner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14.  You should see the way she plays with Sumner.  That boy is so smart because his mom teaches him everyday.  She encourages him and loves him and makes him feel safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;15.  She and SaraJane are two peas in a pod.  They are kindred spirits, and well suited for each other.  I love when Jenna comes home; watching my baby girl run to the door to get her mama is the best part of my day.  I have that to look forward to, and I am grateful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;16.  She's a morning person.  What does that mean?  That means I get a happy girl to wake up to, every morning of my life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17. She bought me a computer for Christmas, using her money that she earned from work.  She's totally selfless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18.  She lets me sleep in like 99% of the time, even when she's tired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19.  She still has friends from when she was a kid.  It's fun to watch her get together with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20.  She'll always make you smile.  When I'm sad, she can figure out a way to make me feel better.  She's insightful like that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21.  I know I give her a hard time about this, but she's fun to teach Primary with.  She takes the edge off and makes the kids very comfortable with tough topics.  And while I'm on that subject...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;22.  She's amazing with kids.  Every kind of kid.  Kids that bite.  Kids that hit.  Kids that have no one to love, and no one to love them.  She'll look at them and see the good in them and help them progress.  She's infinitely patient with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23.  She was born to be an Occupational Therapist.  It's one of her callings in life.  I love her for this reason because it takes a special girl to figure out such a great calling so very young in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24.  And because of her selfless attitude in working so hard for our family, it allows me to continue my journey in life to find out who I really am.  Currently, it has brought me to a retail job in a mall, which I love.  And I'm figuring out a lot about myself because of it.  But it would not be possible without her sacrifice and ability to take care of our family with her job.  I love, love, love her for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;25.  She is my wife, and she chose me.  I chose her.  We're better together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I tried to be sneaky and post a few extra reasons in there.  25 just isn't enough.  I know I'll post this tonight and think of 10,000 more within a few hours.  But she knows I love her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy birthday again, sweetie.</content>

    <title>Hello, world</title>
    <content type='html'>After discussing blog options with my elder brother Adam, i felt encouraged to sit down and update the site. Progress was made, with Wordpress being upgraded and the appropriate app being configured on the new iPad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I won't talk about work too much on this or any other blog, but I'll use it to bang out other weird and random thoughts again.  I've started shooting more photography, so what little free time i have I'd like to spend doing that.  If circumstances allow, I'll finally get around to updating the main web site via iWeb. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's it for now. A brief, but motivating entry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/l_2376_1039_4FFCDFD3-20CB-4202-BD2A-44BD543B05AC.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://outsidetheworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/l_2376_1039_4FFCDFD3-20CB-4202-BD2A-44BD543B05AC.jpeg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Widget</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;11:19pm.&amp;nbsp; What&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;am I doing up at this hour?&amp;nbsp; I really should be asleep.&amp;nbsp; For some unbelievably ridiculous reason, I procrastinated the writing of six two page papers until the last bleeding moment.&amp;nbsp; Yes, that does equal roughly 160 pages to be read and 12 pages to be written, in less than six hours.&amp;nbsp; Come to think of it, I'm fairly proud of myself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Problem is, the papers themselves are complete garbage.&amp;nbsp; I'd probably give them a D if I graded them myself.&amp;nbsp; Simply not too proud of them.&amp;nbsp; But what else can you really expect?&amp;nbsp; I'm just elated that I'll have something to turn in tomorrow night when I head to class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So now, as &lt;/b&gt;some form of outlandish punishment, I sit here at my desk writing more unconscious drivel in the form of this blog entry.&amp;nbsp; I admit it; I'm hooked to writing it.&amp;nbsp; Besides, I did send out the general e-mail to everyone about four hours ago, informing them that Outside the World had again reopened.&amp;nbsp; So, if you followed that e-mail here to my silly blog, welcome.&amp;nbsp; This is all there is for now, really.&amp;nbsp; Please don't be too disappointed.&amp;nbsp; Try to remain temporarily disillusioned.&amp;nbsp; There.&amp;nbsp; That's better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nothing much else to report on, I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; The wife and child got back from Mesa late this evening, both stricken with some sort of flu bug that I desperately hope to avoid.&amp;nbsp; Poor Sumner came home asleep in his mother's arms, and I'm afraid that's the condition that he preferred for the remainder of the evening.&amp;nbsp; Poor guy.&amp;nbsp; You just feel terrible when a child gets lambasted by a virus that should only be meant for adults that can handle it.&amp;nbsp; And by adults I don't mean myself, &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/archive.htms/112403-112703.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;for I have never handled the flu season with much steadfastness.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(see 11/25/03)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, one final thing before I retire for the evening.&amp;nbsp; You've probably noticed that this particular page loads considerably slower than it had previously.&amp;nbsp; Well, that's because I added a weather widget on the bottom of the page.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, whenever you get a hankering to find out what the temperature is in Glendale, you can visit my site!&amp;nbsp; Gee, the utter uselessness of the widget is finally manifesting itself to me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm hoping that it will work itself out and "be more faster" (see Homer Simpson, "Stupid TV, be more funny!" episode), but I'll end up removing it soon because it's just irritating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
On a sad note, my stupid wireless mouse keeps reverting into a paperweight.&amp;nbsp; It's turned itself into an unrecognized USB device 14 times this evening, and I don't believe it's concerned enough with its dismal performance to stop at any point.&amp;nbsp; Alas, time to put it to rest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Speaking of which, this entry could use a rest, as well as my hands.&amp;nbsp; Good day to you all!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Proverbial corners</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I think i've finally turned the corner with the site now.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's about 1:30 in the morning, i'm still awake, i have no idea why, but i wanted to post a blog after my successul revamp of Outsidetheworld.com. Already this weekend has flown by, i'll try my hardest to make Sunday last as long as possible. Earlier today, (Saturday) i helped paint my co-workers house. It wasn't a big deal, kind of fun really, but the wind was tenacious and didn't give us a moment's rest. Paint was flying everywhere, and it seemed to try its hardest to blow me off the ladder whenever i was in a precarious position.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The rest of the day was spent glued to my computer screen, trying to figure out just how to use Microsoft Frontpage. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
May your weekend last longer than mine!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <title>AOL</title>
    <content type='html'>It appears to be Friday again. &amp;nbsp;It also appears that today's entry just might stink.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To avoid this unfortunate outcome, I will try my hardest to concoct a literary masterpiece. &amp;nbsp;Mind you, this doesn't happen all the time, and I guarantee you it won't generally transpire on Fridays. &amp;nbsp;Heaven knows I need these days for myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I have submitted this site to many search engines this week, and if the happy circumstance presents itself where I actually receive visitors because of those efforts, well then; I better do a quality check.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This morning, I awoke with the strangest of thoughts in my head. &amp;nbsp;I do not remember if I was dreaming about this particular topic or not, I simply woke up thinking this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
America Online asking me to come back to them is like my middle school asking me to redo 7th and 8th grade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What's even more ridiculous is that I actually pondered this thought well into my day at work. &amp;nbsp;I was mainly trying to remember something that simply didn't exist anymore, or maybe never did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I'd really like to say that I've put this thought to rest, but no. &amp;nbsp;I'm still turning this thought over in my mind. &amp;nbsp;I've actually (and pathetically) &amp;nbsp;placed some truth into this statement, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I figure that America Online was my stepping stone into the Internet. &amp;nbsp;I'm so far gone from those bright snappy icons and parental controls, that every time I receive one of those &amp;lt;costly&amp;gt; CDs in the mail, I shudder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Why, for Pete's sake, would I want to return to you?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Because we're optimized"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Optimized for what? &amp;nbsp;Faster, superior cleaning action? &amp;nbsp;Increased fuel efficiency? &amp;nbsp;Simplified degradation of extreme variables? &amp;nbsp;What?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
STOP. SENDING. ME. THOSE. COME. BACK. CDS. &amp;nbsp;You have now delved into the realm of unrememberable REM sessions. &amp;nbsp;That's simply too far.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I seem to have hit a tangent. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, Wife and I are into our....17th week of the pregnancy, and Monday will mark the 18th. &amp;nbsp;I still don't really remember the previous, thank you. &amp;nbsp;I'd like to try again, maybe this time, remembering a few moments here and there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that's it for now. &amp;nbsp;If I don't come back tonight to write more, make sure and have a pleasant weekend.</content>

    <content type='html'>This is some of the most fun on the web (especially if you've been on the net for the better part of the last 10 years).  I can't believe some of those old web designs I had.  I only wish I could remember all my old Geocities and Tripod page addresses.</content>

Got a pretty cool effect with the lighting.&lt;p&gt;I like this project; it makes me look at my surroundings differently.

    <title>03/24/2009 - A new way to post</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;The new blog is live. &lt;/strong&gt;It would seem that the hours and days of fuss over the Web hosting paid off.  After many years of crafting each and every blog page by hand, I grew weary of the tediousness of the task.  Each new post meant at least three other pages needed manual updating if I wanted the previous entry archived properly.  This, coupled with the fact that I could never establish a reliable comment or tracking service, pushed me over the edge.  What I found on the other side was WordPress, which is powering the very page you see before you now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It feels alien to me, typing a new blog on this busy looking admin page.  I suppose I'll get used to it in time.  It really was dead simple to install and start using, after all.  I have more options than I know what to do with.  But I like options.  The best part about it?  I can finally allow comments on each blog that I create, and each entry will be automatically archived.  No more manual creation of pages for the blog.  It's both sad and breath-taking at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What scares me stupid is that I have no idea how it all works in the background.  Yes, I got it installed, configured, and customized to my tastes, but the whole program uses programming languages that I am not inclined to learn at this point in my life.  And it uses a MySQL database.  My best guess is that if my database ever dies, so do my entries.  Ho, hum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other project in &lt;/strong&gt;my life is the yard.  After nearly 2 1/2 years, the wife and I have decided to do something with the small plot of land we were granted with our house.  Up until now, it's simply been a grand (not so grand?) swath of rock and dirt, with a single, lonely navel orange tree occupying the north portion.  We've made honorable attempts in the past to make it livable.  We've raked the rock, planted the previously mentioned tree, and allowed Sumner to go nuts with the shovels and rakes.  But we're on the cusp of something big, I think.  We've decided to go with the blank slate approach; that is, we are having concrete poured over most of it.  Pavers would have looked finer, but the financial impact was lessened with the concrete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better visualize how it stands now, here are a few pictures.  I'm very impressed that I figured out how to post these in here already.  Either that points to one of two things: the ease of use of this program, or my utter brilliance at figuring things out.  I tend toward the former.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" title="Looking South" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/yard1.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt; &lt;img class="alignnone" title="Looking north" src="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/pics/yard2.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="614" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should all go down on Wednesday morning.  All in the household are quite glad that we're getting it done this early in the spring season.  When this is completed, we should still have at least two months of cool evening weather in which in to enjoy the newly christened patio.  Even better is the fact that this will be done before Sumner's 5th birthday, which undoubtedly means his party will be hosted in the yard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The funniest part about &lt;/strong&gt;this entry is that it probably won't be seen for a few days.  I've not yet decided how I want to reintroduce Outsidetheworld to friends and family, but I do know I am having some sort of launch event.  Since writing this post bored me to tears, I can only imagine the effect reading it must have on people, so no...this won't be the inaugural post, I'm afraid.  But that statement implies further posts will be full of action and intrigue!  We'll see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if you found your way down the blog to read this fine entry, good on you.  Leave a comment, if you would be so kind, so I know you stopped by.  There's more to come where this came from.</content>

    <title>Comfort</title>
    <content type='html'>Complete comfort. &amp;nbsp;What does it consist of, exactly?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it a song, played at the perfect time? &amp;nbsp;Or is it a picture of familiar place, long forgotten, but easily remembered? &amp;nbsp;How about a mother's touch? &amp;nbsp;Is it anything deeper or slight?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one can quite know the answer to this question. &amp;nbsp;However, comfort is a feeling that I experience quite often now. &amp;nbsp;And, not only do I feel this tangible device, but I can see it in my wife's eyes. &amp;nbsp;I can smell it when I enter my home. &amp;nbsp;I hear it when I listen to my music. &amp;nbsp;And, I can see it when I cast my eyes to heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's not something that I've completely missed, now that I ponder upon it. &amp;nbsp;I felt once that love was something that I was missing all along, and that may be true in one certain aspect, for I have never tasted love like I have now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But now I know love was something that was coursing through me daily. &amp;nbsp;It superseded everything I knew, it comforted me along the way. &amp;nbsp;Have I completed the circle? &amp;nbsp;I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm not four and a half month's away from life's event horizon; my child will be born. &amp;nbsp;It many ways, it still scares me and gives me great hope, never before did I believe that something could pave the way for such conflicting emotion. &amp;nbsp;I'm excited and yet drawn inward. &amp;nbsp;I'm cautious, yet reflected outward. &amp;nbsp;It's an emotional contradiction in every sense of the meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I love it, I crave it. &amp;nbsp;I wish I could document and savor every emotion felt during this time in my life, because I know that experiences like these often pass by too fast. &amp;nbsp;And when I want to turn back and relive them, I realize that I have too much to accomplish here and now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm sure that it will only increase as time progresses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that's it for now. &amp;nbsp;I've worked tirelessly on getting the Professional portion of my Web site completely operational, and I believe that I'm about 99% there. &amp;nbsp;I'll leave the remaining percent as constant motivation to work on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a great day. &amp;nbsp;Go get a free e-mail address, will you?</content>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;03/02/04 ---Come for the Spong monkeys, stay for the fun!---&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Site Stats&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If anything motivates me with this Web site, it's when I check the daily statistics and see what brought visitors here.&amp;nbsp; When I checked this morning, I realized that I had become inundated with requests for one thing:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Spong monkeys&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
It's now apparent that those funny furry animals have made Quiznos very, very famous indeed.&amp;nbsp; For crying out loud, 12 out of 13 queries were for that commercial.&amp;nbsp; The number one hit was "spong monkey", with a whopping 49 inquiries for the past two days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I ran across what appears to be the first appearance of these spongmonkeys.&amp;nbsp; You may find it very interesting and annoying at the same time.&amp;nbsp; The Web site is &lt;a href="http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's an endearing song about how much they love the Moon.&amp;nbsp; Joel Veitch, you're a genius.&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, and you're probably very rich now, too.&amp;nbsp; Jerk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;

&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Teen Girl Squad.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Hard to believe that we're up to &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/tgs5.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;number five&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but that's where life has led us.&amp;nbsp; Strong Bad introduces us to the fact that the others really don't like &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/tgs5.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;What's her Face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And if you look closely enough, you'll see that her last name really is "Herface".&amp;nbsp; The obvious moral of this issue is to avoid dipping your head in the sand at the beach.&amp;nbsp; If you do, the following may happen to you:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
A.&amp;nbsp; You will inhale sand (and cigarette butts)&lt;br /&gt;
B.&amp;nbsp; Birds will find you an attractive perch&lt;br /&gt;
C.&amp;nbsp; Presidents and body builders will stop and mock&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Ah the humor of &lt;a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Homestarrunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Long live the king.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preparations&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Since life is barreling along with the velocity of a snapshot, the wife and I have been afoot with the usual pre-birth preparations.&amp;nbsp; We managed to rearrange the second room and reclaim an entire wall, that will definitely come in useful when the babe arrives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
To sum my wife up in a few words:&amp;nbsp; She is simply amazing.&amp;nbsp; I'd imagine that I could search through a few previous blogs and find that same phrase more than a few times, but it needs to be said more often.&amp;nbsp; On Saturday night, my work held a huge bonus party at a local joint called Rawhide.&amp;nbsp; I was really looking forward to it because there were so many people at work that had been chomping at the bit to meet the lovely dame.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I asked her to take her time and get all dolled up for the event, but what walked through that door was nothing short of angelic.&amp;nbsp; She's eight months pregnant and she looks absolutely perfect, and everyone there knew it.&amp;nbsp; I had the belle of the ball and I was damn proud of it, thanks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
When I returned to work today, most people who had met her that night had more than a few comments for me.&amp;nbsp; She was described as glowing, beautiful, and sweet.&amp;nbsp; More fitting words could not be found, for sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And why am I here&lt;/b&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Too many questions, even more answers.&amp;nbsp; You'll find out soon.&amp;nbsp; Until then, keep coming back.&amp;nbsp; Invite a friend.&amp;nbsp; I take &lt;a href="http://www.quiznos.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;all coupons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>"The Wedge"</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I just got home&lt;/b&gt; from school.&amp;nbsp; Like I mentioned yesterday, I cannot promise that this entry will have depth or meaning, but that's not really a big deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
My brother is chatting with my over MSN and continues laughing about something.&amp;nbsp; That something would be this:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm06SdA-bQnjmFPrvZf-IbCCVBJ_ClXnsqJCHCzXAen3OdNDCGf28sB2plEDVUPdOaNXto1sqJxUh3iFkJpB6j0lNHRqW6q9R4hKcHWNzAqr8mUUoAW6rgLWcNwuN9-1aqfWfE/s1600/button.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm06SdA-bQnjmFPrvZf-IbCCVBJ_ClXnsqJCHCzXAen3OdNDCGf28sB2plEDVUPdOaNXto1sqJxUh3iFkJpB6j0lNHRqW6q9R4hKcHWNzAqr8mUUoAW6rgLWcNwuN9-1aqfWfE/s1600/button.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
In many respects, it deserves whatever criticism comes its merry way.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, and I do mean &lt;b&gt;regrettably&lt;/b&gt;, that is what I used to call my blog.&amp;nbsp; I haven't a clue what I meant by it.&amp;nbsp; I think I was playing around with a thesaurus or perhaps I drew a name out of a black hat in a dark room.&amp;nbsp; Who knows, really.&amp;nbsp; At least it's over with, done.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I mentioned to him that I could just see him laughing.&amp;nbsp; The Wedge.&amp;nbsp; Ooh!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I also mentioned &lt;/b&gt;yesterday that I would try to post another picture of the snowy vistas surrounding Phoenix.&amp;nbsp; Well, a combination of higher temperatures and increased pollution did not permit me to obtain a good shot.&amp;nbsp; But I got one nonetheless.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaoNphSka8GEkNiQSD6TgoRlputtPb7bhSsCtV35Cup3Vs5vTt60dPDROxALFYVn4-FR0Bur8YhxC9xnCf8F2EEtIq_1nP-xWT81V4e-f0bBwNqJRO5tir34ELwDWDsFMrb_dA/s1600/IMG_2044.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaoNphSka8GEkNiQSD6TgoRlputtPb7bhSsCtV35Cup3Vs5vTt60dPDROxALFYVn4-FR0Bur8YhxC9xnCf8F2EEtIq_1nP-xWT81V4e-f0bBwNqJRO5tir34ELwDWDsFMrb_dA/s1600/IMG_2044.JPG" height="242" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sadly, it's just about as blurry as the phone camera pics because I had to digitally zoom so far to get a good enough view of the capped mountain in the distance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And as a special treat, a somewhat better picture of the (I think) C-130 on the tarmac at Deer Valley Airport.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEje9OJf7Kwc_8lCTZnXLRhPwtVXxneNzoA11_bWcloePT6qquNK9dH8wnSmoMtueXldqA7l4V16L6xamDyR9nbCnjwaiLvdmBEO-Q9NelT-A9Rtt_DVuPQ8Jva872IkfVuKiHc8/s1600/IMG_2046.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEje9OJf7Kwc_8lCTZnXLRhPwtVXxneNzoA11_bWcloePT6qquNK9dH8wnSmoMtueXldqA7l4V16L6xamDyR9nbCnjwaiLvdmBEO-Q9NelT-A9Rtt_DVuPQ8Jva872IkfVuKiHc8/s1600/IMG_2046.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Now I'm rambling &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; posting silly pictures.&amp;nbsp; I should probably end this for now.&amp;nbsp; Overall, a fairly anemic post, but fun nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; Have a great day!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Just a short entry today.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;To make up for it, however, I'm providing pictures for your viewing enjoyment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm already looking at the 11:00 hour as I write this.&amp;nbsp; Tuesday is the longest day of the week for me, with school and all.&amp;nbsp; And for whatever reason, class just crawled by tonight.&amp;nbsp; It was all I could do to keep from looking at the time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There was a short unanticipated rain storm today in the valley.&amp;nbsp; When I left work at six, the clouds were barely breaking and the sun was shining in the best way imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The pollution had all been swept away; every mountain range within 100 miles was clearly visible with the orange sunlight casting textures upon them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I tried to take a few pictures to summarize what I saw.&amp;nbsp; Share and enjoy!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Brought back to the site by necessity, really.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Whenever I find out that anybody still checks this site, I feel a pang of guilt. Whenever they ask me to update it, for crying out loud, I feel a call of responsibility.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Also, I promised my wife that I would write more often. How about we start this week off with my news:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3PGfROp3RjvVoeWi0hImaU1hDi_8AT1pea6Q5vXl1OVZM1zKf01hDKakpxmj3B1Z27zYhYkxGKE9bz5A10fxUXJ54DtR-kNgV4ETxh7N37c2KA0f2d4_dMyi8QVIt0ySgO-A2/s1600/ultrasound.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3PGfROp3RjvVoeWi0hImaU1hDi_8AT1pea6Q5vXl1OVZM1zKf01hDKakpxmj3B1Z27zYhYkxGKE9bz5A10fxUXJ54DtR-kNgV4ETxh7N37c2KA0f2d4_dMyi8QVIt0ySgO-A2/s1600/ultrasound.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There (he/she) is. In that blurry little picture, you will find my fetura. Jenna and I are fully convinced that little critter is a boy, however we could still be surprised. We both would love a little girl, Jenna says that I only say that so that I can have a little daddy's girl. I have yet to argue that point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nevertheless, if this creation turns out male, you will not find any happier parents than we.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Other news: Our air conditioner broke, and it has not been the best weekend because of that. The remarkable thing is that it would matter normally, we're nearing the very conclusion of October. Why, it should be 80 degrees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nah, it's still in the lower 100's. Our Weather.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
No matter, we don't need it right now. But the cat loves the tile right now. A lot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Small world</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The world truly is a small place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I had one of those experiences today that made me say just that. Today at institute, after nearly 4 years of no contact, I met the sister of the man that was to be my brother in law. &amp;nbsp;I, being the loud nosey extrovert that i am, asked every person in my institute class what their name was and when i heard the last name of my sisters ex-fiancé (no, not dead. just in Utah, apparently), my jaw dropped to the floor. Equally, the person who i just met also had problems with their jaw when i told her my last name. There was a lot of talk of "how is she, how is he" nonsense afterwards, which i'm sure no one here really needs to know about. It was a nutty experience all the same. I'm just glad she married Kevin* rather than the other guy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I committed myself to play basketball at 5:30am on Friday. 5:30. What was i thinking? Did i actually believe that i would be coherent at that hour? Let alone be able to move well enough to play. Ho boy, methinks i'm in for one long morning. What will probably happen is the alarm will go off and i will rationalize to myself all of my reasons for not getting up until it's too late to go. That's usually the way mornings work for me anyway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I have a "bagel date" on Saturday morning. Just what is a bagel date you ask? Stay tuned and you'll find out...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
*Paxman, Kevin. See relatives, marriage or People that i would like to beat in a vicious game of basketball.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Thanksgiving</title>
    <content type='html'>Happy Thanksgiving! &amp;nbsp;Good news: &amp;nbsp;I didn't get sick. &amp;nbsp;So, I suppose that I over-exaggerated a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since today is a day off, I don't expect to say much. &amp;nbsp;When I awoke this morning, I decided that I should put a little bit of effort into this, though...since I have some free time this morning (rare). &amp;nbsp;Wife is out hiking with her mom right now, I would have gone, but my prohibits such activity at this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, it's officially the time that we can begin listening to Christmas carols, donning our lights on the front porch, and (hopefully) start behaving a bit more kind toward our fellow men. &amp;nbsp;Oh yes, and we have to start shopping, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that I'm married, it's a lot different. &amp;nbsp;When I was single, I had the same people to shop for: Mom, Dad, brothers and sister. &amp;nbsp;A few friends along the way, too...but now, I have to shop for Wife. &amp;nbsp;I'm not saying that it's a chore in any way, but can you imagine the stress that's involved in an undertaking of this measure?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Couple that pressure with the fact that she says that she has so many ideas for gifts for me. &amp;nbsp;It makes me wonder if the ideas that I have for her are adequate? &amp;nbsp;I reckon so, but practically every hour of the day, I am pondering several different gifts for her in my head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see, I want it to be perfect. &amp;nbsp;Any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most peculiar song began playing on the radio...Neil Diamond's version of "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". &amp;nbsp;Isn't he Jewish? &amp;nbsp;Not that that is a reason why he shouldn't sing Christmas carols, it's just....rare. &amp;nbsp;Well, I suppose that paved the way for Barbara Streisand to sing them, too... (shudder)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that's more than plenty for today. &amp;nbsp;Again, I wish you a happy Thanksgiving, and please, kick this holiday season off right. &amp;nbsp;Be a little kinder, share a bit more of yourself to others, and put a can of food in a donation bin. &amp;nbsp;And no canned beets. &amp;nbsp;Make it something the kids will enjoy!</content>

I'm sorry to report that I have severe writer's block tonight. Too much and not enough on my mind, I suppose! Tomorrow our ward does have its first basketball game, and most likely I will write about that tomorrow. Keep up the good work, everybody. Tchau.&lt;/div&gt;

I went to Payson, Flagstaff, Tucson, Utah, California, and so many other places, it's hard to keep track. &amp;nbsp;And it was always so cheap. &amp;nbsp;Road trips were a cinch when you only paid $8 to get there. &amp;nbsp;Foolishly, I let the wear and tear accumulate too rapidly. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I also realize that this will probably be the first and last Tesla I ever own, as they have grown prohibitively expensive over the last few years. &amp;nbsp;I have proudly explained in the past that I purchased her for $36k, before the $4000 reward from the federal government for purchasing an electric vehicle. &amp;nbsp;That same vehicle now costs $49k now, with no rebates, and costs still rising. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Astoundingly, she was sold for $33k with a ton of miles racked up. &amp;nbsp;I am sure she will bring the next owner a lot of joy once she is all fixed up and has some new shoes on her. &amp;nbsp;She only brought me joy, that's for damn sure. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhddFP-LQ43_CFGThSZe5n0wgg2ipm5D3hebU1z3UlFbBVzyZ7zmpZB_ONaLeovhTIMJk1lmlaY4kSgEeqghHjbXOjmejZrz7Wa79l-Yn-3qxhvWIpNmDRXHXdYEK1YVX27CVZOBcO46GawfV1wJIGL5SNP8scwOFbMP39-ErUapzt5Q-VsA" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_7115455836337561554" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhddFP-LQ43_CFGThSZe5n0wgg2ipm5D3hebU1z3UlFbBVzyZ7zmpZB_ONaLeovhTIMJk1lmlaY4kSgEeqghHjbXOjmejZrz7Wa79l-Yn-3qxhvWIpNmDRXHXdYEK1YVX27CVZOBcO46GawfV1wJIGL5SNP8scwOFbMP39-ErUapzt5Q-VsA=s320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;June 29, 2022. &amp;nbsp;Battle damage included, she's still a beauty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;And while this story is laden with undeniable privilege, irony, and hyperbole (which I will not deny and am truly ashamed for), it's also punctuated by the fact that the car I purchased to replace her with is &lt;i&gt;already in the repair shop, &lt;/i&gt;having landed there a mere 15 miles after picking her up from the dealership. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I am confident still that when I truly drive my next car, she will help calm my feelings of regret. &amp;nbsp;But for now, everything is exacerbated by the fact that the car I chose to replace Petra with has already fallen ill due to a small manufacturing defect. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Crossing my fingers that things go smoothly in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>aloha ryandavid.blogspot.com blogger found your site via search engine but it was hard to find and I see you could have more visitors because there are not so many comments yet. I have discovered site which offer to dramatically increase traffic to your blog http://bestwebtrafficservice.com they claim they managed to get close to 1000 visitors/day using their services you could also get lot more targeted traffic from search engines as you have now. I used their services and got significantly more visitors to my website. Hope this helps :) They offer best &lt;a href="http://bestwebtrafficservice.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;services to increase website traffic&lt;/a&gt;  Take care. Mike</content>

    <content type='html'>I just spent a few moments looking back at old posts I made with my  &lt;br&gt;Treo. I was quite against the ol&amp;#39; iPhone once upon a time, wasnt I?&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&amp;#39;d say the iPhone is a better device, by about 600%.  I&amp;#39;m  &lt;br&gt;anxious for Monday morning, when the new iPhone will supposedly be  &lt;br&gt;announced.&lt;p&gt;I already told my dad that i would be buying it, post haste. He just  &lt;br&gt;rolled his eyes and smiled. He knows me all too well.&lt;p&gt;RD Burningham&lt;p&gt;Sent from my iPhone</content>

    <title>Quick entry</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Only a quick &lt;/b&gt;entry tonight.&amp;nbsp; It's been a long day - again - and I'm looking forward to hitting the sack.&amp;nbsp; The baby shower was a success, or so I heard.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't there, I skipped out quietly as the guests arrived.&amp;nbsp; The baby boy got quite a few neat things, he should be very happy once he arrives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
My wife found it amazing how such a small thing could need so much stuff.&amp;nbsp; As I looked around at the treasure trove of items, I knew she was right.&amp;nbsp; From clothes to bathing supplies, this kid needs a lot of consumables.&amp;nbsp; Something tells me he'll be more than worth it all though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We're heading to the Jazz-Suns game tomorrow night.&amp;nbsp; Here's hoping that it's a good game.&amp;nbsp; You all know who I want to win.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As I have grown older, Disneyland (with its little brother, California Adventure) has rapidly expanded with new rides and lands that pay homage to their newer IP. In my mind, I see the shift to contemporary details began with Bug's Land, which sadly no longer exists but within the memories of Disney fandom. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Walking into Bug's Land back in 2000 was transformative; from the entrance, you were transported to a world where everything was bigger than you. It wasn't just sights, but the sensation of touch and smell that pulled this magic together.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlE8ol5jyu7K4m2cozriOyZA1SR3EmEcrTAve8c_k30NLaRpB1xldj1hswNhtdGD_XqadCjBM661zIUcfjPitI6Amti0b2MSsc-ubmMrXHIWvZR6C1EtebPPfnJrt0Q2dVAcA_CQJI3a_pQBN6RPkigf9ZFTnNvZwQQDc5bXi0UHSwO9zj8Q/s3024/IMG_4481%202.heic" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="3024" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlE8ol5jyu7K4m2cozriOyZA1SR3EmEcrTAve8c_k30NLaRpB1xldj1hswNhtdGD_XqadCjBM661zIUcfjPitI6Amti0b2MSsc-ubmMrXHIWvZR6C1EtebPPfnJrt0Q2dVAcA_CQJI3a_pQBN6RPkigf9ZFTnNvZwQQDc5bXi0UHSwO9zj8Q/w400-h400/IMG_4481%202.heic" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Just one example of Cars Land&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fast forward another decade, when Cars Land was launched to critical acclaim. &amp;nbsp;Before going, I read article after article, and saw countless pictures posted to both social media and professional journalism sites, but nothing prepared me for what I encountered upon my arrival. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't know the level of collaboration that exists between Disney/Pixar's film studios and Disney's park organization, and frankly, I don't want to know...but it was mind blowing to see Cars Land in person. &amp;nbsp;Again, every sensory faculty attached to my human frame was catered to with remarkable precision. &amp;nbsp;This was Disney's Imagineering with all of its intended magic and might. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you've ever wondered why some people are such zealots when it comes to Disneyland, perhaps my overly verbose descriptions and sumptuous fawning can give you some idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which brings me to my final word for the day; Star Wars Land: Galaxy's Edge. &amp;nbsp;It launched nearly three years ago, during which time I've seen countless pictures and listened to the reveling of friends, relatives, and others. &amp;nbsp;I prepared myself accordingly. &amp;nbsp;Expectations were set to be blown away by what I would see.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUMGA9jlcsHKg-nL2pcDvosMtAtfkDyOWTsj5R4toEn5Th5YpipO4yVGPBwefQX0VnK_LY2OmN3bBfIxI8GqBngnGRQaPTXlH7w-bkXaYBC4JLJVrPRpm0NNmI39JPZL6QmfxKKBwFToBOqm0NxMnPG6NhC_rKyh_xJJfhS7ULMKtHo-a3VA/s3024/OriginalPhoto-669224525.953226.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="3024" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUMGA9jlcsHKg-nL2pcDvosMtAtfkDyOWTsj5R4toEn5Th5YpipO4yVGPBwefQX0VnK_LY2OmN3bBfIxI8GqBngnGRQaPTXlH7w-bkXaYBC4JLJVrPRpm0NNmI39JPZL6QmfxKKBwFToBOqm0NxMnPG6NhC_rKyh_xJJfhS7ULMKtHo-a3VA/w400-h400/OriginalPhoto-669224525.953226.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Yep, that's a full-sized Falcon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still couldn't believe my own eyes. &amp;nbsp;As opposed to Cars Land, where Radiator Springs was the blueprint whereupon the Imagineers set their sights, Galaxy's Edge is an unknown quantity; a brand new planet within the Star Wars universe. &amp;nbsp;Yet you know upon walking inside this land that you are a part of the Star Wars experience. &amp;nbsp;Every single detail, even down to the custom Coca-Cola bottles commissioned for this area of the park, screams of an immediate transportation to Batuu. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the final day, the wife and I spent one of our final hours there. &amp;nbsp;We didn't ride any rides, didn't eat any food; we just sat or walked around. &amp;nbsp;Life is complicated, fraught with stress, drama, and enough heartache to fill the Millennium Falcon. &amp;nbsp;So, to be able to escape to this tiny land within a small park in what was once tracts of orange groves in Anaheim California, the mindless wander amongst the fruits of some of the world's best designers was a welcome respite.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Successful recovery</title>

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Successful recovery&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Ok, so I exaggerated yesterday.&amp;nbsp; The e-mail writing class did not do any serious damage to my writing, as many of the rules have now been assimilated into my collective verbosity.&amp;nbsp; No more knife through ice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As I type this, my wife runs around behind me.&amp;nbsp; There are boxes upon boxes of stuff strewn about.&amp;nbsp; Who knew that two people could wreak such terror on a tiny one bedroom apartment.&amp;nbsp; And I wouldn't even call ourselves packrats, either.&amp;nbsp; Quite the contrary.&amp;nbsp; I throw away as many unneeded effects as I can throw a stick at.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
My cat seems to understand that there's something going on, too.&amp;nbsp; He's moping about the house with an extremely dejected look on his face.&amp;nbsp; Yes, human expression is valid on animals, as proved by my feline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I suppose that I should get off my duff and help the cause.&amp;nbsp; It frightens me how many boxes there are.&amp;nbsp; So many boxes....*shakes head*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'll see you on Saturday or Monday.&amp;nbsp; I make no promises for either.&amp;nbsp; Have a great weekend!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Advertising...</title>
    <content type='html'>Usually, advertising on Web sites is targeted pretty well to me. But today, that changed in a flash. Just read this.  I was absolutely bewildered when I saw it.  The part that gets me is where is says, "Your sister's wedding has been fixed."  Do weddings break? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I get it. It's India.  But it's still an odd advertisement to find on a tech blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRC3kQGgApYia7b06Hkvcx02KeFD1JSWRSCIz89HqqKB9YAlVefp5ihBCMCcYSR1kydeTbsEv6MuxT92kDuzrlU5KkawXPWphEXzvTnjDRexxHVLFgFD7fuXEsX21hQW9yg_6X/s1600-h/930166.gif"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5106763169352143890" style="CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRC3kQGgApYia7b06Hkvcx02KeFD1JSWRSCIz89HqqKB9YAlVefp5ihBCMCcYSR1kydeTbsEv6MuxT92kDuzrlU5KkawXPWphEXzvTnjDRexxHVLFgFD7fuXEsX21hQW9yg_6X/s320/930166.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Autumn, you've been found</title>
    <content type='html'>Guess what? &amp;nbsp;I found Autumn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwqlFI5sPKIssJuJkoetP35LSKXGyysQfD7dG-44rLuCfUq7F8IHNUntxgksNURiI7Rs5e6Gkf1UvQKYuSLoK8JQ51TCzIZbJkhehud4KbbdcJY499dz2g3JDOEY0amb56BUmR/s1600/fall.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwqlFI5sPKIssJuJkoetP35LSKXGyysQfD7dG-44rLuCfUq7F8IHNUntxgksNURiI7Rs5e6Gkf1UvQKYuSLoK8JQ51TCzIZbJkhehud4KbbdcJY499dz2g3JDOEY0amb56BUmR/s1600/fall.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's residing in this lonely tree, right outside of my apartment complex. &amp;nbsp;I would imagine that this image will be nothing more than ephemeral, as it could be 90 degrees come tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and for any of you who may have realized my mistake of assumption yesterday, I apologize. &amp;nbsp;Apparently, my spellchecker will pass anything with that may be hyphenated. &amp;nbsp;No, really...watch!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Zippy-gyro. (no problems!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nike-Reebok. &amp;nbsp;(not an issue!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ryan-David. (nice!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enough of that. &amp;nbsp;I spent another hour at the mall tonight, and I didn't manage to make much head-way. &amp;nbsp;Or maybe I'm simply writing this so that I can mislead my wife into believing that I didn't purchase anything? &amp;nbsp;Hmm, interesting, interesting. &amp;nbsp;Now all she can do is wonder. &amp;nbsp;(or, she could just ask me...I can't lie to that pretty face of hers)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other news: &amp;nbsp;Google has finally combed over my site in its entirety. &amp;nbsp;Go ahead, try it! &amp;nbsp;I'll bet you find plenty of random links you didn't even know existed. &amp;nbsp;Gone are the days of defunct links and 404 errors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry, that's all I have for December 3rd. &amp;nbsp;I'm tired, been up since 6:00am, and I still need to do the laundry. &amp;nbsp;See you tomorrow!</content>

    <title>Wallpaper</title>
    <content type='html'>Can't stay and play tonight, folks. &amp;nbsp;I did something to my back and need the Rx of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, all I have to offer is this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqKLbnXOtv1tIloJpsY3P54NzZimNMD7Ihc8K6xojZ4aQbMoYWM0uHnqxKwGe3Z55zPrRFdm3oY5ltLfNvchnkMQ3wwwKU8VToBty2XFcZQnyL0eBeLEQvsrz3v8NKGQOyCmCS/s1600/wallpaper.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqKLbnXOtv1tIloJpsY3P54NzZimNMD7Ihc8K6xojZ4aQbMoYWM0uHnqxKwGe3Z55zPrRFdm3oY5ltLfNvchnkMQ3wwwKU8VToBty2XFcZQnyL0eBeLEQvsrz3v8NKGQOyCmCS/s1600/wallpaper.JPG" height="480" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's an old wallpaper that I created while living in California. &amp;nbsp;The words are taken from a song by Sting. &amp;nbsp;Enjoy! &amp;nbsp;Be back tomorrow.</content>

    <title>AC Status</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Run acstatus.exe&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Air Conditioner Status checker V 2.0 .......&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All systems nominal. Have a nice day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
End Program&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For those of you out there that don't speak nerd, that means that my air conditioning unit is now working fine. The problem found? Blown fuse up on the roof. Time spent fixing it: Approximately 15 minutes. Minutes late to work? Approximately, no wait; exactly 3 minutes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But I assumed it would come to that. The repair person (it happened to be a woman, it was) arrived unannounced at about 8:40 or so, and both Wife and I had to be off for our respective daily duties. But she assured us that it wouldn't be that long, that the problem probably lay up on the roof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Long story (already too long), she replaced the filter, too. It seemed evolution had sprung from it's dusty depths, but she ended that with one fell swoop.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In other news: Error. Other news not found. Please check the name, and try your call again later. Message 3 4 5 2 4.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Pano</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As a matter of fact, &lt;/b&gt;yes, I was putting the Web site off for quite a few days.&amp;nbsp; Why do you ask?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm still coming to grips with the new design.&amp;nbsp; I do not know whether it holds any particular aesthetic value or not, and the lengthier column makes me feel as if I haven't typed nearly as much material.&amp;nbsp; I am tempted to beat my hands against the keyboard in a chaotic fashion to pound out meaningless drivel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Overall, I feel the page to be quite boring; it holds nothing of value to me, so it might be gone/changed soon.&amp;nbsp; Below this entry you'll notice a new linkable calendar that I whipped up (ie, divided one table 30 times, whoopee!), but I quickly realized after creating it that I only create entries once per week at the moment.&amp;nbsp; 25 out of 30 links now become useless!&amp;nbsp; That is, unless I write everyday.&amp;nbsp; I have a few ideas for that, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It's been a pretty &lt;/b&gt;fine month of June so far, though the days recently passed have brought much higher temperatures than in the beginning of the month.&amp;nbsp; Late in May, we bought the wife a new bike complete with a secondary seat for the little one.&amp;nbsp; We've wanted to ride bikes again for years, but some other priority seemingly stood in the way.&amp;nbsp; But we finally did it, and it was perfect weather in the evening times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We haven't ridden in about a week or so now.&amp;nbsp; Reason?&amp;nbsp; The temps rose 20 degrees in the sundown hours.&amp;nbsp; That's just enough to make me think twice about the whole affair, at least until the monsoons hit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But!&amp;nbsp; It will be a riding night tonight.&amp;nbsp; Armed with water bottles and a stubborn constitution, we will enjoy our outdoors time, by gosh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Side note:&lt;/b&gt; the boy just waddled up to me and asked me if he could give me a hug.&amp;nbsp; I love Sundays.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Just for fun, &lt;/b&gt;how about a chopped up panoramic view of my front yard!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And maybe a little more fun?&amp;nbsp; A picture of where the magic begins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
A picture of Sumner out in front of our house&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfet-3WinLjTQdXSzjeTUKjkYITIzQnQiP30VygkbAzMXKxJ9sVOzjQ7SqfjZ7VvAdRVwQ389HLHahTzY5A72QX-7SW_Zu5shW8A_oHpQTmF_wcvVmLDGXhvgBM0_hG58TKah/s1600/sumneroutside.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfet-3WinLjTQdXSzjeTUKjkYITIzQnQiP30VygkbAzMXKxJ9sVOzjQ7SqfjZ7VvAdRVwQ389HLHahTzY5A72QX-7SW_Zu5shW8A_oHpQTmF_wcvVmLDGXhvgBM0_hG58TKah/s1600/sumneroutside.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Well, now I'm&lt;/b&gt; just doing the Web equivalent of bashing my hands against the keys, so I'll stop for now.&amp;nbsp; The nightly bike ride may have just been postponed due to inclement bad child health; my wife just asked if we could give Sumner Pepto-Bismol.&amp;nbsp; That's usually not a good sign of things to come.&amp;nbsp; Have a great day!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
New month, new something or other.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nth day of inbound sales training, and i'm beginning to forget who i am. I find myself having to be reminded that i was hired for an entirely different department, and that i can pretty much negate 1/3 of the banter that goes on in the classroom. Today we had a team leader from the sales floor come in and do a little Q&amp;amp;A with us, and i believe that at one point, it almost came to fisticuffs when they decided to bombard the poor man with questions about "commission structure". So i sat there, pen in my mouth, trying to focus.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And now i'm sitting at home, listening to a recording that i made off the radio back in 1994. It's a group of songs from a radio show called Open House Party that i believe is still on the air somewhere in this country. The only reason that it holds any significance, however, is because all of these songs remind me of a specific time in my life. In 1994, as a lad of 15 years, i recorded this album 2 days before i left for EFY. And as i sit here 8 years later and listen to my tape, i still feel the same as i did that night.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Ah, what the heck...here is the play list.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Title - Artist&lt;br /&gt;
1. Harmony - Erasure&lt;br /&gt;
2. You Spin Me - Dead or Alive&lt;br /&gt;
3. What's Up? - Four Non Blondes&lt;br /&gt;
4. Amazing - Aerosmith&lt;br /&gt;
5. Oh What a night! (really, i have no clue who did this rendition, but it was really big at all the church dances back then...)&lt;br /&gt;
6. Happy Nation - Ace of Base&lt;br /&gt;
7. We Will Rock You (Techno Mix) - Queen&lt;br /&gt;
8. Black Hole Sun - Soundgarden&lt;br /&gt;
9. 100% Pure Love - Crystal Waters&lt;br /&gt;
10. Show Me Love - Robin S&lt;br /&gt;
11. Regulate - Nate Dogg &amp;amp; Warren G&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
A stellar line up.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;VIVA EFY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type='html'>One step forward, two steps back.  What could have been revolutionary is merely a digital afterthought to most folks already carrying a smart phone (such as yours truly).&lt;p&gt;If it doesn&amp;#39;t do more or even as much as current devices, why &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot;?&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?  &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly, without an iPhone.</content>

A special thanks to my friend Dan for letting me use his computer. My other friend Eric came back from U of A to find his parents computer completely dead, so i let him borrow mine for the weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I drove another 150 miles today for work, I'm half expecting my car to yell at me. Either that, or refuse to go anywhere anymore. Arizona roads can be torture, and the traffic makes it no better. Tomorrow: The fated bagel date. Too bad i forgot to call the person i'm going with...i ended up calling her at about 10:00 pm this evening. Yeah, that's me. I'm as smooth as silk when it comes to the women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Hope your weekend is memorable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bagel Date</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, it wasn't so much a "bagel date", per se, more of an early morning freeze party...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For all those whose curiosity was perked with the infamous "bagel date" entries, you may wish to go here to see the pictures. There's only three, no one was really excited about getting their picture taken that early in the morning. I'd rather keep those friends of mine than have them beat me silly from taking too many pictures. It was extremely cold this morning, especially for Arizona. At one point it availed me nothing to have arms, because those that i had were lifeless as could be. It was really fun though, the people in the pictures are Adam, Staci and Jenna. They are my friends from my home ward here in Glendale. We hiked around Thunderbird mountain and then feasted upon "hot bagels" and washed it all down with a strange carbonated fruit drink. "A single serving of fruit", the bottle said. Too bad i got half of it on me from shaking it up. Alas, twas only a half serving of fruit...You may also notice from the picture of me that i don't know how to smile. That would be because my face is frozen. Or maybe only half frozen? Everything came in half sizes today, so why not!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Hooray for replies, i got a good one from my friend Heather to Thursday's post regarding the memorial for the WTC disaster. You can find that post here, or you can go to my MSN site and search for it. I encourage anybody to tell me what they think about what i've written.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What? What's that you say?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I write about silly nonsense?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Exactly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Here's to nonsense, in all of its countless forms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Keep the faith.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

(as my wife calls it,  it being inconsistent with its speed..)&lt;p&gt;We were sad to leave the comforts of the cabin behind, a polar opposite to numerous other visits when we had packed up and left not a moment after waking.  Maybe it was the unusual quiet of the surroundings, or perhaps the imminent commencement of another work week...we weren&amp;#39;t quite ready to leave.&lt;p&gt;I had the great fortune to finish Harry Potter #6 while away.  It&amp;#39;s always nice to achieve a lazy goal while on vacation, and I had wanted a good start for Harry Potter #7, which is undoubtedly waiting for my arrival on my front porch.&lt;p&gt;A good journey, for sure.  No, not necessarily marked by the live blogging I had hoped for...it is decidedly tougher than I had imagined, dividing one&amp;#39;s time between relaxing and writing.  Truthfully, I hadn&amp;#39;t so much as glanced at my phone more than a few times per day, a grand testament to the diversionary successes of our holiday.&lt;p&gt;More to come later, certainly.  Thanks for visiting, thanks for the comments.  &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>The Cabin</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The weekend draws to a close, &lt;/b&gt;and I'm not ready for another work week.&amp;nbsp; Sure, it'll still happen come 9:00am tomorrow, but I won't like it.&amp;nbsp; I won't even pretend!&amp;nbsp; We had a lot of fun this weekend, the family and I, and the fun isn't just over yet.&amp;nbsp; I can hear baby Sumner in the bathtub, laughing away like a wet pirate.&amp;nbsp; Actually, he did take his stuffed pirate toy into the bathtub tonight.&amp;nbsp; Another McDonald's treasure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sumner continually reminds me of how precious the little things in life are.&amp;nbsp; The smallest surprise will make his day complete, from gumballs to ice cream cones (come to think of it, most of his favorite things are food-based.&amp;nbsp; I wonder where that comes from).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So now, willingly, unwillingly, the work week beckons to me and I must follow its call.&amp;nbsp; I do have much to look forward to shortly, however; we're taking a family trip to California on Thursday night to spend some time at the in-laws cabin at Lake Arrowhead.&amp;nbsp; I'm terribly happy with that idea.&amp;nbsp; Fantastically infatuated, maybe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
When the in-laws decided to make the big purchase of the cabin, I was outspokenly pessimistic about the whole thing.&amp;nbsp; It just seemed to far away, too expensive, and too complicated for the family.&amp;nbsp; But now, after a few trips there, I can only think of one other place that I find more beautiful (read: Snowbird) and I always look forward to going back.&amp;nbsp; It's up in the mountains of Southern California, (which by the way, I did not know existed before) and the trees are endless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The architecture is inspired from Europe; some Swiss and German elements are spattered throughout the town.&amp;nbsp; But the Village is where the buildings truly shine.&amp;nbsp; Here, take a look.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Not the greatest pictures, I know, but to make up for it, how about a cute picture of Sumner?&amp;nbsp; (taken quite a while ago)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhudLZkFc3AxMk8dyCRkZSM5bSqeYApBEVhlfwQaW3_MZj8ibdt-yO-p5wJSWsTRf7S6G-QYfBTsOADnXmpHa41LLi2FfaukNPq9YlghdwsCiPdNJ_W3LrZ74i91Iv_Ljp6pdWU/s1600/IMG_1701.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhudLZkFc3AxMk8dyCRkZSM5bSqeYApBEVhlfwQaW3_MZj8ibdt-yO-p5wJSWsTRf7S6G-QYfBTsOADnXmpHa41LLi2FfaukNPq9YlghdwsCiPdNJ_W3LrZ74i91Iv_Ljp6pdWU/s1600/IMG_1701.JPG" height="237" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That was taken lakeside in Lake Arrowhead just over one year ago, and yes, that is ice cream dribbling down his mouth.&amp;nbsp; I told you most of his joys stemmed from ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, I'll tell you what.&amp;nbsp; (This is dangerous.&amp;nbsp; I'm making a promise) I'll take better pictures this time around.&amp;nbsp; I'll even post them when I get home.&amp;nbsp; Heck, I might even take some new pictures of the family while we're all up there.&amp;nbsp; It's about time, anyway.&amp;nbsp; I do have some recent pictures of the boy.&amp;nbsp; These were taken about a week ago after I made some cookies and Sumner decided it was his turn, not mom's, to have the beaters.&amp;nbsp; Cookie Dough!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVvuz4PqGQ7_i9FWAhQwUbcQWLHJU-rGCrls_YGGGVHKA6BxAQN978_BA3pzNaEoackDpWdGxLhM0Y3iwmxuRzV-pcSwVWVFNBAdPhPAwgM9AeMyZS6MuEGrA9uT9XqQU5Njg6/s1600/IMG_2158.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVvuz4PqGQ7_i9FWAhQwUbcQWLHJU-rGCrls_YGGGVHKA6BxAQN978_BA3pzNaEoackDpWdGxLhM0Y3iwmxuRzV-pcSwVWVFNBAdPhPAwgM9AeMyZS6MuEGrA9uT9XqQU5Njg6/s1600/IMG_2158.JPG" height="320" width="241" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And now, for the reason that I live and love.&amp;nbsp; The two people that make my life amazing every day.&lt;/div&gt;

Yeesh.&lt;p&gt;The train is mostly empty now, but it&amp;#39;ll fill up quickly as we follow the track.  Sumner doesn&amp;#39;t remember doing this a few years ago, which is sad only because the trip with him as an 18 month old is imprinted on my mind so thoroughly.  I&amp;#39;ll keep the memory going for him, then.&lt;p&gt;The train started moving now, and I am in the rear facing seat.  It makes me a bit ill to type in this environment, so I bid you adiue for now.  More pictures as the day progresses!</content>

    <title>Everything is nothing</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Everyone should learn at least one lesson per day&lt;/b&gt;, if not more.&amp;nbsp; The lesson for me yesterday was this: never try to learn PHP and implement it into your Web site 30 minutes before you go to bed.&amp;nbsp; If you do, you'll end up with a defunct link and empty promises.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Best Buy&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I visited my very favorite store again tonight, Thursdays are very rewarding days because I can take the car wherever I please.&amp;nbsp; I wandered over toward the video games section to check out the new James Bond game.&amp;nbsp; It's supposed to be different because not only does it use the real actor's names, it uses their voices and personage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The title of this new game is "Everything Or Nothing".&amp;nbsp; Yeah, that's good, and I suppose that it'll suit the game just nicely.&amp;nbsp; But aren't the titles of Bond movies supposed to be a little more self-defeating?&amp;nbsp; Why not, "Everything Is Nothing".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, that sounds much better.&amp;nbsp; Ten times more obscurity in that sentence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;That's it&lt;/b&gt; for now.&amp;nbsp; I have mind-numbing fatigue washing over me.&amp;nbsp; See you again tomorrow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Mish-mash</title>
    <content type='html'>First of all, you are very lucky. (or unlucky, as the case may be)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I had a digital camera, I'd be following suit of James Lileks' site right now. &amp;nbsp;For the entire month of December, he's on hiatus from the Bleat. &amp;nbsp;Instead, he is giving his readers their fill of photographs and other assorted mish-mash. &amp;nbsp;(spell checker didn't find a problem with the word "mish-mash". &amp;nbsp;Spectacular!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good news this past weekend: &amp;nbsp;I managed to inflict a major dent in the holiday shopping list. &amp;nbsp;I'd love to give everyone the run-down of everything purchased, however; my wife is an avid reader of my site, and that would ruin all of the fun. &amp;nbsp;Suffice it to say that Target is a blessing and a curse at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To word it very delicately, it simply has everything. &amp;nbsp;I spent two hours at the mall and came up very shorthanded. &amp;nbsp;But just one hour at Target gave me loads of ideas. &amp;nbsp;What a boon!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other good news: &amp;nbsp;The cat is no longer sick. &amp;nbsp;Wait...that really isn't that good of news. &amp;nbsp;Now, instead of sleeping at nights, he runs around our room like a sugar-injected 5 year old. &amp;nbsp;He also eats like 78 times per day now, too. &amp;nbsp;I don't want a fat cat...so maybe I should stop feeding him bacon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it wasn't MY fault that he ate the bacon grease. &amp;nbsp;He did that of his own volition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hmm....nothing but good news today, I guess. &amp;nbsp;I reckon that I can spice this entry up a bit with a dash of bad news-salty-flavor, but that simply wouldn't be conducive to the Christmas Spirit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And if anyone has wondered where the Blog was yesterday, my apologies. &amp;nbsp;The holiday season will probably provide less time for writing, and I fully expect the entries to become a bit more emaciated as the 25th approaches. &amp;nbsp;But I make a promise: &amp;nbsp;No more missed entries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, that's it. &amp;nbsp;See you tomorrow!</content>

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Yep, this is what i do when i have nothing really fun to write. It's probably because i'm feeling just a bit too lethargic today about, oh, everything. I figure this picture will whet your appetite for things to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Take care.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Postscript: I took this picture at the airport today, i just thought it looked neat for some reason.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Brand new year</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Major announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://bloggenpucky.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My brother has rejoined the ranks of the blogging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Ok, back to work.&amp;nbsp; The fun has passed for now, it's back to what we know.&amp;nbsp; Ah, but this time there's something distinctive about 2004.&amp;nbsp; Actually, in the attempt to write, I may have missed a larger point.&amp;nbsp; There are quite a few discrepancies between this year and it's 03 counterpart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I have much to look forward to, and even more to accomplish than ever.&amp;nbsp; Let's pray for the best, neh?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Anyway&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't about to write anything tonight.&amp;nbsp; Really, I wanted to wait until the morn, as I hadn't yet cleared my mind and given time for rational thought.&amp;nbsp; But, seeing as how my wife is sick with something terrible, I thought that I'd give her the bed for a little while before I head off for the night.&amp;nbsp; Besides, I'm worn, but not quite tired; I'm in that limbotic stage betwixt the two.&amp;nbsp; The day was spent in constant curiosity of what to do next.&amp;nbsp; We weren't quite bored, but we were always on edge, wondering what sounded fun and worth doing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
So, my wife painted while I fiddled around with Movie Maker.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, you probably saw that creation yesterday.&amp;nbsp; If you didn't, it may be worth viewing.&amp;nbsp; You just have to find the Media page.&amp;nbsp; In my disjointed construct of the Blog page, I never did place a perma-link to that particular site.&amp;nbsp; My apologies!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I also played a lot of Mario Kart.&amp;nbsp; And I do feel kind of badly about that, as I purchased that game as a present for my wife.&amp;nbsp; Don't misunderstand me, she likes it probably more than I; however, I hardly gave her a chance to play in the past three days.&amp;nbsp; It's just so very rare that I find a game worth playing any more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
We did attempt to visit Tagliani's again, too.&amp;nbsp; To our sadness, it was closed for the New Year.&amp;nbsp; We expected it to be closed.&amp;nbsp; We called beforehand and reached an answering machine, the sad culmination of every attempt to reach a living being.&amp;nbsp; But we were determined to find out for ourselves, and found ourselves in an empty parking lot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
So we went to Fazoli's.&amp;nbsp; Since it was my father's birthday, and we're short on cash, we decided that dinner would be a thoughtful yet less expensive gift.&amp;nbsp; Why we went to Fazoli's, I still do not know.&amp;nbsp; Everything there tastes like wet rubber.&amp;nbsp; The sauce is ok, but lacking in areas.&amp;nbsp; I used to like the breadsticks until they began soaking them in a tub of butter before they handed them out to unwary patrons.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"Another breadstick for you?&amp;nbsp; They're fresh out of the oven"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"Oh, no thanks.&amp;nbsp; And don't you mean deep-fat fryer?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
But I take one (or more) anyway, because I always feel so sorry for the person offering them.&amp;nbsp; Please!&amp;nbsp; Take my fatty-bread from my little bonnet.&amp;nbsp; It's warm, and if I give it all away, they'll let me sit down!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Phew.&amp;nbsp; Sorry about the various and sundry tangents that I have gone off on lately. Those should diminish as life picks up again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
That's the gist of it today.&amp;nbsp; Oh, I'll be back on Monday, don't you forget.&amp;nbsp; Have a great weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>04/22/09 - Sleep doesn&amp;#39;t come easily at 9pm</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;So far, &lt;/strong&gt;no updates from the hospital, so I doubt I'll be volunteering there this week.  I'd just like to know, you know?  Because knowing helps you feel better about the time when you didn't know.  So it will be a few more weeks of waiting.  I'm excited to get out of the house a little bit, gather some outside stimuli to dust off the cobwebs in my mind.  Sometimes when I write, I feel like I am peeling away at old information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some points of excitement for me, &lt;/strong&gt;as I'm getting iLife and iWork tomorrow for my little Dell Macbook.  The thing that worries me is whether I'll have enough room for all the neat programs they come with.  I really only want Pages from the iWork suite, and really want to try out iPhoto from the iLife collection.  iPhoto has some great features that should make my thousands of digital photos easier to find.  And Pages just removes the clutter while you write.  I find it harder and harder to write with all that can distract you on this screen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The family is gearing up for the trip to Utah next week; we're leaving the heat.  I just hope it doesn't snow while we're there.  I'd like to take at least one trip up into the mountains, you know?  Hike a little bit (lot).  I'm not much for skiing anymore, so the less snow on the mounts, the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't put nearly enough pictures on this blog, &lt;/strong&gt;I know.  It's extremely difficult to do with my blogging tool.  You're thinking to yourself, "Didn't you change the whole thing so it would be easier?"  Yes, yes I did.  And in the process, added 8 more steps.  I could be back to the old format before you know it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talked to Sumner's &lt;/strong&gt;teacher a little bit after school today, seems the lad can't stay in his seat.  Most other aspects of his behavior in the classroom are steady for now, but the chair is his mortal enemy, it seems.  Strangely, this makes me smile, only because that trait is so much like his pop.  In so many ways, he has the charisma and predilections of his dear mommy, so whenever I get to mark one in the daddy column, I like it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, I never wanted to stay in my seat.  In my young mind, there were about 50 other things that I would rather be doing, or seeing, or experimenting with, and I was actively categorizing them in my mind for later activity.  I see the same in Sumner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as SaraJane goes, she cut two more teeth in the past week, with a few more looking ripe for  departure.  She's also cruising around the couches more and more, looking braver for that first big step away from the hand hold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It breaks my heart to see her grow so fast, because little girls turn into big girls, and big girls turn into young women that find a way to get married.  18 years is never enough with a daughter.  I hope that, somehow, she sees how much her daddy loves her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My goodness, I've reached the magical 500 work threshold yet again.  That's more than enough.  Goodnight, and thanks for reading.</content>

    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
You can't help but laugh, right? Right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I could say that i've been too busy to write, but that wouldn't be entirely true. I could make excuses like, "i didn't have anything interesting to write", but that would be completely false. By now, most of you give this site a passing glance just to see if the date has changed, and then shoot off an email or an IM telling me to get writing! So, here goes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Life is full of surprises both good and bad. I'm beginning to realize on a much deeper level how blessed and, i dare say, how lucky I am. Some people i know would call me a blasphemer for daring to say "luck", they say they don't believe in luck, maybe i have created my own, but i swear it's out there. Life is, at times, deeper than we realize. If we look outside ourselves and our daily circumstances, we will see the tangible synchronicities of life and the connections we draw from nature. If we can grasp this, it could be well with us...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I don't want to say that i've realized any great truth, or that i've discovered something that hasn't been said before. But in this journey i call my life, i can't help but understand the eternal truths that i've known for my entire existence when they are proposed to me in several different fashions. Truth is everywhere, in varying degrees, and if we filter out any part of it because of our own arrogance or closed mindedness, then we are all the poorer for it and must learn things the hard way. We all have more experience than we realize. Somehow we must tap it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So anyway, i hope all is well with everyone. Sorry about the long delay, i swear it won't happen again...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The final bow of 2003</title>
    <content type='html'>So, this is it. &amp;nbsp;The final remnant of 2003. &amp;nbsp;The curtain falls on a great performance, the actors have taken their final bows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we could rewind the entirety, we would see many occurrences, some good, some bad. &amp;nbsp;To be brief, it was a wonderful year, definitely one that I would never go back and change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And looking forward, we can anticipate a clean slate. &amp;nbsp;For some, it marks the beginning of a new life, a life where goals can be set anew and wounds can finally be repaired with care. &amp;nbsp;For others, it generates a new passion for living, and encompasses the supernal nature of birth. &amp;nbsp;Sadly still, it also represents a sense of despair, or a realization that life becomes unnaturally harder as time goes on. &amp;nbsp;To these people, a new year is nothing more than the turning of the pages in a book, a novel which, to their knowledge, only ends in one sour note.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wish to confirm that for myself, it signifies a brand new day. &amp;nbsp;Other years have had their familiar nuances and flavors; in contrast, this year contains much that is unknown and starkly in direct opposite from others past. &amp;nbsp;For instance, I can now look forward to the challenges and immense pleasures of life with my wife, who can assist me and keep me going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later on down the road, I will be accompanied by another unnamed individual, who will provide me with even more love and lessons. &amp;nbsp;In other words, a family will now be my help, my power, my encouragement. &amp;nbsp;No longer will I be generating false hopes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other news: Wife and I visited the aforementioned restaurant again tonight. &amp;nbsp;I figure that our desire to dine out has something to do with the holiday season. &amp;nbsp;The levity and brightness of the season leads to a longing to be out amongst the crowds, listening and observing the general happy states of others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was, as usual, a brilliant meal. &amp;nbsp;We attempted to find another dish on the menu that sounded appetizing, but we gave up, realizing that it's always best to stick with what you know. &amp;nbsp; We've never been very adventuresome when it came to food. &amp;nbsp;Why, even tonight we tried to locate another restaurant to try out. &amp;nbsp;After much searching, we gave up, and I looked at her and mentioned that it would have been so much easier if we would have just heeded our first instinct!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No pictures, yet. &amp;nbsp;I really don't want to get into the rut of making empty promises, because that doesn't make for a happy visit. &amp;nbsp;As soon as I have the time, something blog-worthy will be posted for your viewing enjoyment. &amp;nbsp;It should be noted that I'll cook up some tunes, too...I just pray that I have the cleverness to concoct something that won't make you want to bang your temple against the broad side of your monitor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that's the end, 2003 is finito. &amp;nbsp;May you enter into the New Year in health and happiness. &amp;nbsp;(I can't resist it) I'll see you next year!</content>

He form tackled me as soon as I entered the crowd with my Treo.  He said his intervention was surely better that the alternative; apparently the entire iPhone kiosk is surrounded by laser beams that destroy any Windows Mobile device.&lt;p&gt;I kid, I kid.  I did manage to snap a few shots.  Impressions?  Yeah, it&amp;#39;s nice.  Perhaps a bit too nice.  &lt;p&gt;Sumner is begging me for lunch.  More later!&lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>Fight!  Fight!  Fight!</title>
    <content type='html'>T minus six days. &amp;nbsp;Begin final preparations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ok, I finally have something. &amp;nbsp;Please keep in mind that this picture may be so visually stimulating that it may cause more than a few gasps of disbelief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But before we get to the picture, a little background. &amp;nbsp;Lights, please?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few days ago, our friends came over for a little pre-holiday get-together. &amp;nbsp;Presents were exchanged, but that wasn't the best part. &amp;nbsp;Laughs were shared, but that isn't why I'm writing. &amp;nbsp;My entry today is about the introduction of one little kitty and one tiny puppy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the picture describes it the best, I should mention that our cat may have missed his calling. &amp;nbsp;It appears to me that he should have been a prize fighter, as he has one of the best left hooks I've ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe he was just trying to play with the dog, and vice versa, but my cat doesn't know how to play clean. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, enough verbiage, on with the picture:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuOiiP4KnzD5WJO8GL3_5SNe0434X9o6-8QjPVpdaksQPZ0hGiFRxscz0eeR80EtRk7YAJkeAYWSfWgPZlbLH0et_N5dhg5pjRw8kT-9kWDd7j0ECPJokcxcNg0mauXIKNWsF7/s1600/catanddog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuOiiP4KnzD5WJO8GL3_5SNe0434X9o6-8QjPVpdaksQPZ0hGiFRxscz0eeR80EtRk7YAJkeAYWSfWgPZlbLH0et_N5dhg5pjRw8kT-9kWDd7j0ECPJokcxcNg0mauXIKNWsF7/s1600/catanddog.jpg" height="242" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thumb nailed it because I wanted to keep it at a respectable size. &amp;nbsp;My friend and I (thank you, Ryan) couldn't capture the two in mid swing, but I remember that this picture must have been taken right before the punch came.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, the hour for work draws nigh, so I must end this blog for the week. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for dropping by, I hope that the reading value has not decreased. &amp;nbsp;I'll see you back here on Monday morning. &amp;nbsp;There may be additions to the Media Library this weekend. &amp;nbsp;Happy holidays!</content>

But they always provide plenty of contrast and variety for the eye. &lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;d been a bit quicker on the shoot, this would have come out better. But it&amp;#39;s nice enough. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Helga Viking&lt;br&gt;Film: DreamCanvas</content>

    <title>"Tolerable"</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs03/news/story?id=1724968&amp;amp;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs03/news/story?id=1724968&amp;amp;partnersite=espn"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CBS APOLOGIZES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Gee, for some reason, I saw that one coming.&amp;nbsp; Wife and I didn't plan on watching the Super Bowl, but we did for a little while.&amp;nbsp; Something about the game draws me to it, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; And we surely didn't plan on watching the silly half-time show.&amp;nbsp; But my wife wanted to see Jessica Simpson, and that's ok, because she's tolerable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But the real problem is, we didn't plan, neither did we want, to see Janet Jackson's breast.&amp;nbsp; Nor did the rest of the millions of views, I'd imagine.&amp;nbsp; I can just see my brother, shaking his head and thinking in his mind that this is why he lives in rural Utah.&amp;nbsp; And I agree with him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New start page&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You may have &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;noticed it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; upon entrance to the site.&amp;nbsp; It's not quite finished, I should mention.&amp;nbsp; That took me the whole weekend to create.&amp;nbsp; I hope you like it, because it took a lot of my creative energy this evening.&amp;nbsp; But I like it, and it adds that friendly Apple-esk feeling.&amp;nbsp; Smooth lines, friendly colors, and easy to understand.&amp;nbsp; At least, easy for me.&amp;nbsp; I spent the whole weekend looking at it, for crimeny's sake.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Funny story&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My friend requested that I help him a little bit last Friday.&amp;nbsp; He was moving to another place because things got a little loud at his previous digs.&amp;nbsp; I told him that i'd be happy to, and that I would drive out to his new place shortly after work to assist him with some of the moving.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After quite a drive, I wound my way to his new address.&amp;nbsp; I got out of my car and took a quick glance about.&amp;nbsp; Everything was brand new.&amp;nbsp; Everyone's yards were sans-landscape.&amp;nbsp; There were boxes and clearly you could discern the smell of fresh wood.&amp;nbsp; Plus, my friend hadn't told me who he was moving in with yet.&amp;nbsp; He decided to keep that a mystery from me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So here I was in this new neighborhood, musing to myself over the surroundings.&amp;nbsp; My friend greeted me outside, and bade me entrance to the house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"It's empty," I said.&amp;nbsp; "This is a brand new house."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"Welcome to my house," said my friend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"But how..."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
"Welcome to my new house!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
So, my friend bought a house.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations, man.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This week will be better.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; I promise.&amp;nbsp; Now, off to bigger and better things.&amp;nbsp; Hope your weekend was great.&amp;nbsp; Here's to a new month.&amp;nbsp; Cheers!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Labyrinth</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Third night in a row &lt;/b&gt;staying up way too late.&amp;nbsp; But this evening, I was especially preoccupied with getting everything ready with my change of e-mail address.&amp;nbsp; That's right, I give up.&amp;nbsp; Spam ruined my favorite e-mail address.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But not to worry!&amp;nbsp; My outsidetheworld.com account came to the rescue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I had so much on my mind to write about tonight, but it all fails me now.&amp;nbsp; I procrastinated writing far too long, I'm afraid, and now all I have left in me is babble.&amp;nbsp; Unmitigated verbal meandering.&amp;nbsp; Oh wait, I do have a few pictures.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Below you will &lt;/b&gt;find a place at work that I frequent whenever I'm having a rough day.&amp;nbsp; It's an eleven circuit labyrinth, and it's supposed to be a place of meditation and prayer.&amp;nbsp; Kind of like Pooh's thoughtful spot, but not as cheerful or blustery.&amp;nbsp; (Correction, Pooh's "Thotful Spot")&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I never understood the many misspellings in the books and cartoons, but they did me no harm, so I should just be quiet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyway, on to the pictures.&amp;nbsp; Rather than try to remember the purpose of this labyrinth and attempt to paraphrase, I simply took a picture of what "they" said it is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsKRq9dHhuRIDnR0zWpqhIk4KNKjLtKuVaBS4TIBVLXjeCFK9c4CeRVu31QuK2vQUYu66vL8bW7gxaLC7UM-7ISMYa6IvtSgBffS9_UMoKo6OhpVzWqjtl5nWUTdHfW6gHYhWy/s1600/IMAGE_00063.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsKRq9dHhuRIDnR0zWpqhIk4KNKjLtKuVaBS4TIBVLXjeCFK9c4CeRVu31QuK2vQUYu66vL8bW7gxaLC7UM-7ISMYa6IvtSgBffS9_UMoKo6OhpVzWqjtl5nWUTdHfW6gHYhWy/s1600/IMAGE_00063.jpg" height="320" width="239" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmrXRuz6oW3_TandXNinfi8JpTH39rOsyCqh58R0OGFr_KkcsfI1I5CHoV6FYrliA2AinBfvrJ0fSSB3FA2Jo48f0C_BMzk0HHXdW7JbkIyPIzrCL2hEuXt_9Cw5BAc2KJcOJp/s1600/IMAGE_00064.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmrXRuz6oW3_TandXNinfi8JpTH39rOsyCqh58R0OGFr_KkcsfI1I5CHoV6FYrliA2AinBfvrJ0fSSB3FA2Jo48f0C_BMzk0HHXdW7JbkIyPIzrCL2hEuXt_9Cw5BAc2KJcOJp/s1600/IMAGE_00064.jpg" height="242" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Again, you'll have to forgive the fact that these pictures were taken with my phone's camera.&amp;nbsp; But, there it is.&amp;nbsp; The place where you could find me if all else at work had failed.&amp;nbsp; And by all else I mean a package of candy and a game of pool.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It was actually quite beautiful outside today; it was much preferable to the office environment.&amp;nbsp; It was just so blasted cold inside my office.&amp;nbsp; I couldn't keep warm or awake, a terrible and rare combination that leads to poor productivity.&amp;nbsp; So, outside to the labyrinth I went, and was greeted by 70 degree sunshine and the chirping of birds.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I think this'll do for the evening.&amp;nbsp; Have a great day and week ahead...it's almost Friday.&amp;nbsp; We can make it to Friday, right?&amp;nbsp; Right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
P.S. The weather widget was never right, so I removed it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 39 degrees at 11:00am?&amp;nbsp; Nope.&amp;nbsp; Good riddance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Just a few meandering thoughts on this Christmas Eve</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgGky_fTByTt9xn8FkzxIP_sDpmVF0fuBGHa1ggc9BMh9-U48Tlk4Aewtjief58CbePVo8g-N6nzbzPePOaX-rvqT83fHrRorr1rn8lNOZf0ZBl6B2a9UDNvc3ebP6x-4UtHP2csy3UY0GMDVF4jwFhJWdGb8qf-GIDDV9b4MmzXDbF-jc9yw=s1231" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="923" data-original-width="1231" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgGky_fTByTt9xn8FkzxIP_sDpmVF0fuBGHa1ggc9BMh9-U48Tlk4Aewtjief58CbePVo8g-N6nzbzPePOaX-rvqT83fHrRorr1rn8lNOZf0ZBl6B2a9UDNvc3ebP6x-4UtHP2csy3UY0GMDVF4jwFhJWdGb8qf-GIDDV9b4MmzXDbF-jc9yw=w400-h300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I love this part of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas'. &amp;nbsp;Throughout the episode, there's this crazy energy. &amp;nbsp;No one sits down, no one breathes. &amp;nbsp;But outside, in the crystal clear air, Charlie Brown finds a moment to connect with his own heart, and, hearing Linus' words inside himself, is at peace.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to breath it all in; they're only this young once. &amp;nbsp;I'm not saying the magic won't be there in the coming years, but time has a confounding way of transforming it so as to make it nearly unrecognizable. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that this Christmas season brought you what you desperately needed. &amp;nbsp;If your heart is broken, may it find comfort. &amp;nbsp;If you are feeling desperately disconnected from humanity, start with you. &amp;nbsp;Figure out how to get your head to talk to your heart again, and from there, you may find that the tools you need are already with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas, y'all.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>It's definitely a Monday</title>
    <content type='html'>This is definitely a much later post than I prefer.  So far today had been jam packed from the get-go, from getting Sumner up and out the door, dropping him off at school (he didn&amp;#39;t cry! Gravy!) and the myriad other things I&amp;#39;ve accomplished today.&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to take a few minutes out and post a bit.  Anyone else having the typical Monday?  Keep this in mind...the Fourth of July is right around the corner.  &lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, everything is in order for a spectacular Fourth.  I have my secret stash of fireworks ready and waiting.  Weather.com says it will be a ridiculous 115 that day, so the &amp;#39;works may go off by themselves.  &lt;p&gt;More later! Thanks for visiting. &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>Xbox 360 failure rate</title>
    <content type='html'>Joystiq.com just posted an article about the failure rate of the Xbox 360, referencing a DailyTech article that states the actual failure rate is around 33%.  Dang.&lt;p&gt;I happen to know someone who has experienced the lovely &amp;quot;red ring of death&amp;quot;, and i&amp;#39;ll tell you, it doesn&amp;#39;t make me comfortable.  See, we bought ours around the same time and mine has been giving me grief for the past few weeks.&lt;p&gt;Rest assured that if my 360 is visited  by the red ring of death, Microsoft won&amp;#39;t hear the end of it.  One out of three Xbox owners have to agree with me.&lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <content type='html'>Seriously, the clouds from these past few days have been absolutely incredible! &lt;br&gt;The picture captures that almost perfectly, and I say &amp;#39;almost&amp;#39; perfectly because there aren&amp;#39;t any saucer or flapjack clouds in this sunset :)</content>

    <title>Howling wind</title>
    <content type='html'>Hah, well...I tricked you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's the problem. &amp;nbsp;You see, I didn't intentionally mislead you. &amp;nbsp;The date you see affixed to this entry is in fact the day when Wife and I learn more about our new child. &amp;nbsp;But the problem lies in the fact that I always (generally, can I say that?) write these entries on the night before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So that means the smashing update that I promised simply has not yet occurred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bummer. &amp;nbsp;So, that means another short space of time for readers to wait. &amp;nbsp;But rest assured, I will most likely not make you wait until Wednesday morning to learn of the news. &amp;nbsp;I'll set to it right when I get home from the appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wind is howling outside tonight. &amp;nbsp;It started to really kick up when I left for lunch earlier today. &amp;nbsp;It's hardly a good thing when the vehicle you use weighs slightly less than you do. &amp;nbsp;It's a remarkably good thing that I only have to wander across the street on that scooter. &amp;nbsp;Which, by the way, my friend is interested in purchasing. &amp;nbsp;That would be a boon, says I.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So where was I. &amp;nbsp;Oh yes, the wind. &amp;nbsp;It actually makes it feel a tad bit wintry outside. &amp;nbsp;That does make me feel better, as earlier this month, Mr. Weatherman informed Arizona viewers that this month's weather would be unseasonably hot. &amp;nbsp;Not warm, mind you, but hot. &amp;nbsp;That's simply not the way that anyone wishes to begin their holiday season, especially someone like me, who at one point in his life, viewed ten feet of snow piled outside his bedroom window on any given morning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, we take what we can get here in the land of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
16 days till Christmas. &amp;nbsp;Might I recommend a gifts for you and yours?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006LV79/qid=1070937452/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/104-1232353-2862328?v=glance&amp;amp;s=photo&amp;amp;n=507846" target="_blank"&gt;This camera is smokin'&lt;/a&gt; I don't know if you can find a better deal on it, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let's take a surprise check at what my kitty is doing right now:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dobby lookin shady...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR-Ksou-XbARB6VhpytHV8CUO28P4L_hmlVB5EXoUvUy1cdPsKoU8B7DmmamWEBKP2qhXqmJO0YtboJXBJo33E4fhMklkjwEUOo1Wek8snwu2knQkCjRTsvIev-MgwdvxiJAJi/s1600/shady.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR-Ksou-XbARB6VhpytHV8CUO28P4L_hmlVB5EXoUvUy1cdPsKoU8B7DmmamWEBKP2qhXqmJO0YtboJXBJo33E4fhMklkjwEUOo1Wek8snwu2knQkCjRTsvIev-MgwdvxiJAJi/s1600/shady.jpg" height="261" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Looks pretty shady to me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright. &amp;nbsp;That's enough for today. &amp;nbsp;It's just sad when you have to draw upon the comedic prowess of your feline companion to keep your blog afloat on any given day. &amp;nbsp;Today, my friends...is simply not going to be one of those days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good day to you. &amp;nbsp;I'll see you tomorrow. (or less!)</content>

It&amp;#39;s an 11 year old Kodak DC215. While only 1 mp, it took nice shots. I&amp;#39;m thinking of loading some batteries and taking it for a spin later. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Chunky&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1935</content>

    <title>Two scoops</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4490526/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kobe says the Jazz are out of the picture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Too bad he doesn't understand that they don't want him anyway.&amp;nbsp; If the Jazz front office ever expressed interest in him, not only would I be surprised, but I'd be willing to bet their offer was extremely modest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
You know what an exceptional organization looks for when they sign players?&amp;nbsp; It's not just talent.&amp;nbsp; It's not the experience, the rings, or the publicity.&amp;nbsp; It's the character of the man himself, and Kobe hasn't got it.&amp;nbsp; He bemoans the Jazz organization because their skit involving him was "just not right."&amp;nbsp; He was quoted as saying that he was angry because the skit made fun of Karl Malone.&amp;nbsp; I disagree.&amp;nbsp; I believe he was upset because the skit exposed him a little bit more than he found comfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
He stated that events such as the skit on January 24th must be taken into consideration when choosing teams.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; However, when you A. Have been charged with rape and B. Continue to care about your pocketbook above winning, it does not reflect well when pursuing another team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The media and press state that the Jazz "poked fun" at his legal troubles.&amp;nbsp; Regretfully for Kobe, this digs much deeper than sheer legalities.&amp;nbsp; If convicted, he could face years of prison and/or a life-time of probation.&amp;nbsp; He has to rebuild his carefully crafted image from the ruins that he himself created.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp; wonder why he doesn't watch his words more carefully.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, he has an insurmountable task ahead of him.&amp;nbsp; He may be acquitted,&amp;nbsp; he may continue to play basketball at a level others envy, but he will never, ever earn the respect of millions again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So why devote so much space to this?&amp;nbsp; Because to me, this type of stuff matters.&amp;nbsp; It's just another compass for the way the world turns, another drop in the bucket that has overflowed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Phew.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Sorry about that.&amp;nbsp; In the future, I will give ample warning when entering extreme screed mode.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Camping.&amp;nbsp; Again.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Over the last weekend, I went on another camping trip with some buddies of mine.&amp;nbsp; This time, we didn't forget the firewood, and we even brought charcoal briquettes and a load of mesquite chips for a bit of flavor.&amp;nbsp; My oh my, steak does taste better when not prepared over a bustling flame of dura-log.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Alas, this may be my last trip for a while, as the time draws ever nearer for the birth of our son.&amp;nbsp; In five weeks, life will change dramatically.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I had better set things straight around the res' and spend as much time with my wife as possible.&amp;nbsp; I don't feel oppressed by the pending arrival; however, there comes a point when you finally realize there never was a point to turn back.&amp;nbsp; The implications of the responsibility of a child are astounding, at best.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Everyday I think quietly to myself.&amp;nbsp; Everyday I find myself more drawn to this person that I have never known.&amp;nbsp; Everyday I become more of a father, and the boy inside of me is transferred to the soul inside my wife's belly.&amp;nbsp; At first, it was an unwilling process, fraught with tears and confusion.&amp;nbsp; Now, it's more of an honor.&amp;nbsp; Expectations are that this young boy will soon be my son.&amp;nbsp; Aspirations are a great deal higher.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's it for now.&amp;nbsp; I decided to write this entry a little early tonight so as to grant myself a little more free time to pursue other venues.&amp;nbsp; I may return later tonight, but most likely not.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, I'll be doing the same thing for the foreseeable future, like it or not.&amp;nbsp; Cheers!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;03/10/04 @9:28pm.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Honestly, I didn't expect to return tonight.&amp;nbsp; But while what I have to say is brief, I couldn't keep it for tomorrow's entry.&amp;nbsp; I just went for a ride around the adjoining neighborhoods on the ol' scooter.&amp;nbsp; I love this time of year.&amp;nbsp; Every scent is enhanced and magnified by the cool night air.&amp;nbsp; I don't feel a rush to get inside to warm up; instead, I can keep my head up as I stroll about outside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I even caught a hint of some orange blossoms in the area.&amp;nbsp; That's an event that has become less and less common, I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; It used to be that everywhere you went, you could inhale the heady aroma of the nearby orange groves.&amp;nbsp; Now, you must make due with the occasional orange tree.&amp;nbsp; But it still smells great.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This time of year is what living in Arizona is all about.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>The first vacuum of many</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It was just a week, &lt;/b&gt;ok?&amp;nbsp; Not too long to be away from the world of blogging.&amp;nbsp; Let's see...there was the Fourth of July, that's a pretty good excuse, and I finally went back to work full time after nearly, no wait, exactly two months.&amp;nbsp; I had a bit on my plate, so forgiveness must be in order.&amp;nbsp; It's granted?&amp;nbsp; Then we move on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Before I start with the weekend explanation, I must tell you something.&amp;nbsp; A few months ago, I gave the wife a copy of Tetris.&amp;nbsp; Two weeks ago, I stole said cartridge from her and called it my own.&amp;nbsp; Shady.&amp;nbsp; But slowly, surely, I climbed the records and managed to pull over 1,080 lines in that game.&amp;nbsp; Yeah.&amp;nbsp; That's a lotta lines, but nowhere near the world record.&amp;nbsp; And I haven't any idea what it is, but suffice it to say that some people just don't. ever. quit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Enough of that.&amp;nbsp; We had a superb weekend, with Friday night designated solely as a night for grocery shopping.&amp;nbsp; The destination for shopping was predicated upon the choice/price of the cereal, and let me tell you, Fry's lost by a wide margin.&amp;nbsp; I always knew that I had certain price point tolerance for boxes of cereal, and I found out exactly what that was on Friday.&amp;nbsp; We could find no more than two boxes of cereal priced below the $3.00 mark.&amp;nbsp; Ok, two boxes of worthwhile cereal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So in the middle of the aisle, I fretted for nearly five minutes where to go.&amp;nbsp; I knew that Alberston's had a fine sale on cereal-stuffs, but I also felt that the other-stuffs selection there left much to be desired.&amp;nbsp; Super Wal-Mart?&amp;nbsp; Fantastic place, great prices.&amp;nbsp; But whenever I go there I have the hardest time deciding between a loaf of bread and a 32" LCD Television.&amp;nbsp; Tough choice, I know.&amp;nbsp; I'm a silly American.&amp;nbsp; (I'm kidding, but only about the decision.&amp;nbsp; I stand firm that I am, in fact, a silly American)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Then, the wife proposed an interesting alternative: The Wal-Mart Marketplace.&amp;nbsp; I had never been there before, but apparently, it was Super Wal-Mart without all those &lt;span class="s1"&gt;fantastic &lt;/span&gt;nasty techno-distractions.&amp;nbsp; It was decided then.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Standard stuff really, although I was fairly disappointed by the prices.&amp;nbsp; The wife disagrees with my quite heartily, but I found the prices to be slightly, but not entirely, higher than Super Wal-Mart's.&amp;nbsp; There were several items to be admired though, such as the beverage center at the entrance to the store.&amp;nbsp; Not much selection at the fountain, but you pay on the honor system!&amp;nbsp; It begs you to, in fact.&amp;nbsp; Drop $.50 in the bucket and take your beverage.&amp;nbsp; I loved it.&amp;nbsp; I didn't use it, but I loved it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
We filled two shopping carts that night (we really were out, out, out of food) and wife and I played the usual game of "how much money did we spend?"&amp;nbsp; I guessed $175.00, while Jenna was a bit less (or is it more?) conservative with an estimate of $195.00.&amp;nbsp; It's a fun game, you should honestly play it each time you go to the store, but only if you're really bad guessers.&amp;nbsp; The grand total was (drum roll) just over $161.&amp;nbsp; The merriment!&amp;nbsp; We were just blessed with extra cash! Not really, but it felt grand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Enough about Friday.&amp;nbsp; On to Saturday.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As I sit here, I wonder to myself why we chose Saturday's particular destination, especially considering the mountain of cash we had already spent at Wal-Mart, and extra-especially considering my aforementioned fascination with electronic distractionary flo-blap.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yes, we went to Costco.&amp;nbsp; The only place where you have to decide between a 10 piece table and chairs, a 42 lb carton of Mayo, and a bitchin' 50" plasma.&amp;nbsp; And they all cost the same amount of money.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh, we went to take back our vacuum cleaner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Short side story about the vacuum cleaner, because this entry is already nauseatingly long and obtuse.&amp;nbsp; I heard the belt slip, I knew it slipped, but I kept vacuuming for just too long and I MELTED the dang thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Let's just say that Costco is really, really great about taking stuff back.&amp;nbsp; The lady didn't even want to hear my story.&amp;nbsp; (I can't understand why?)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And Sunday?&amp;nbsp; Well, Sunday was spent in bed, because I'm still recovering from this darn surgery.&amp;nbsp; The boy is now in bed, and my wife is off studying and learning.&amp;nbsp; Great gal.&amp;nbsp; Love her to pieces, I do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's all for this week, may each of you find time to do something in the interest of Summer time.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and never forget the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/archive.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page.&amp;nbsp; Never know what you'll read about there!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I&amp;#39;m finally feeling zapped; but several things will give me energy in the coming days and weeks. &lt;p&gt;Working late tonight, so this picture was all about finding suitable light for a quick shot. It seems this new film gives random results, as if the film had expired long ago and only a few exposures are worth their salt. &lt;p&gt;The tree turned out well enough.  I&amp;#39;ll post an example of a failure as well. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Adler 9009&lt;br&gt;Film: Dylan</content>

    <title>The work of heaven</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For the first time I saw the work of heaven,&lt;br /&gt;
The shape of our future,&lt;br /&gt;
The shape of all our history...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I know it's true&lt;br /&gt;
It's written in a sky as blue&lt;br /&gt;
As blue as your eyes, &lt;br /&gt;
As blue as your eyes...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Sting, I Was Brought to my Senses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

    <title>Merry and bright</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Greetings on this fine Thursday.&amp;nbsp; Warning:&amp;nbsp; Extreme laziness today.&amp;nbsp; Not much below.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Today, I had a day off.&amp;nbsp; It was needed because I had a doctor's appointment to attend to at 4:00pm.&amp;nbsp; Too bad, because I forgot about it entirely.&amp;nbsp; My wife had to remind me about it about a gazillion times, (special note, gazillion also appears to be acceptable to Word's spellchecker) and I still forgot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Now, something for the rest of you.&amp;nbsp; MSNBC has a neat &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/987180.asp"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Digital IQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; test.&amp;nbsp; I took it, wife did too, as did my brother and parents.&amp;nbsp; Go ahead and take that test and then come back here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I won't tell you what I got, as that is unimportant in this case.&amp;nbsp; And the fact of the matter is that it's entirely lop-sided on the downward cycle.&amp;nbsp; If you haven't got a home network or if you don't know what bluetooth is, then you're in for a rough time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Many MSNBC readers who completed this IQ test sent its creator a word or two.&amp;nbsp; I found the following entry quite amusing:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Name: Ryan&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Hometown: Mesa, Ariz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just like stereotypical nerds, the people who aren’t scoring high get all flustered and upset because it strips them of their geekness — the only thing that they have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Digital IQ isn’t about who sets up the most elaborate wireless network ... it’s also about knowledge of Internet culture. Teen Girl Squad, anyone? (Kudos if you know what this is)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As for the “Web site designer” who says you suck for not using Mozilla ... he suffers from typical hypergeekism. To mimic the years of abuse from their peers in grade school, they continue to abuse themselves by using outdated and/or inferior technology so they can be L33T.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;They love to make everything difficult. “Ha? Use an FTP Client? I do all my work command-line. Outlook? Are you crazy? I spent a few weeks writing my own JAVA app for that. I might share it with people on my Website. Check it out — new messages are in 0000FF.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And don’t get me started on the “OMG, I HATE OFFICE AND MICROSOFT. Y R U USING IT, N00B???” people.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For the record, I got 120 on the quiz. Again, its more about culture than engineering, n00bz.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p3"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I simply found that refreshing.&amp;nbsp; If you missed the Web site above, you can find that &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/987180.asp"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; (do I say that too often?) Since I've provided you readers with a different picture every day of this week, I had better stick with the program and fuzz you another cam-shot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Run phone_pictures.exe&lt;/span&gt;: ....cat....cat....cat....Wife....cat....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
(something's definitely wrong here)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Ah, here we go.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Is this a house aflame?&amp;nbsp; Nope.&amp;nbsp; It's just my fuzzy camera phone ,and it appears that &lt;span class="s1"&gt;Frosty&lt;/span&gt; may have gotten himself in a jam.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiqYT6GrE6Wwa-fouqBjkZYE1VhPetpbBodpJlWJvQDhBJuG0VMwro3Zw288HcZZC7dTLN9yxg1cWtV0UG5FBqpuJagyo39YgBh4SpZCbSXdrUeVDYLEtI8AIk0qlJaxAEBzPY/s1600/frosty.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiqYT6GrE6Wwa-fouqBjkZYE1VhPetpbBodpJlWJvQDhBJuG0VMwro3Zw288HcZZC7dTLN9yxg1cWtV0UG5FBqpuJagyo39YgBh4SpZCbSXdrUeVDYLEtI8AIk0qlJaxAEBzPY/s1600/frosty.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p4"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Please, don't put Frosty on your roof.&amp;nbsp; He just doesn't belong there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How is he going to get down?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
14 days left!&amp;nbsp; May your days be both merry and bright!)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

I would take two steps, he would shuffle a few to the left. His gaze never left mine, and when he flew, he never gained more than a few yards' advantage. &lt;p&gt;It almost seemed a game; the heron daring me to try again before taking flight.  People stopped and stared at my vain attempts at closer shots. Ultimately, I chose to halt what could have been a real annoyance to this poor bird. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn't make him any less beautiful. And my pops thinks he was just a baby, too. He seemed big enough to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

More storms are expected tonight, continuing until tomorrow afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;I snapped this picture in between storms, risking water damage to my trusty, yet still two-years old, iPhone. A bit of editing with Snapseed produced the results you see here.</content>

    <title>A journey for photos' sake</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
A thousand apologies.&amp;nbsp; In my desire to continue my vacation well into Monday morning, I avoided my computer like month-old milk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But we're back to the grind now.&amp;nbsp; It's approximately 7:30pm, and I'm late.&amp;nbsp; But fear not, because I have something to show for the delay.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pictures&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I took that adventure that I had been wanting.&amp;nbsp; I ventured outside my apartment vicinity for what seems like the first time in weeks.&amp;nbsp; I feel like this because in my moments of solitary meditation last week, I continually envisioned the same scenery in my mind over and over.&amp;nbsp; It all consisted of the area surrounding my apartment and work local.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Blah blah.&amp;nbsp; My journey took me to downtown Phoenix, where I photographed the Viad Building and its immediate surroundings.&amp;nbsp; Please let me explain, I haven't had much experience with digital photography, and I've had even less experience with this camera.&amp;nbsp; So, those pictures didn't turn out that great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That is, until I visited the botanical gardens east of town.&amp;nbsp; At first, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of variety and poor supply of vivid color on my trek around the jardin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But after I took off my durn-blasted sunglasses, which have more scratches than my brother's 45's after I listened to them as a child, I began to see the small bits of color that were strewn about the area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyCl52ZlQXRXgS9TnRDrNBg2fCJZCwQHQygZezkQTuCEwxRMarln4B9UinDsZpVErSHbkb4BtKUI1XTVpet7RCVrJnir24BheSzPCe9xV2gaEMxF4qG5lB1JPGFjU0wmqn0dGf/s1600/favorite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyCl52ZlQXRXgS9TnRDrNBg2fCJZCwQHQygZezkQTuCEwxRMarln4B9UinDsZpVErSHbkb4BtKUI1XTVpet7RCVrJnir24BheSzPCe9xV2gaEMxF4qG5lB1JPGFjU0wmqn0dGf/s1600/favorite.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
My Favorite&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I sincerely enjoyed that part of my day.&amp;nbsp; I found it relaxing, invigorating, and educational (although I failed to write down any of the names of the flora)&amp;nbsp; The most amusing part of the garden was the Library.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
This bibliotek was placed adjacent the visitors center, so i stopped there before leaving.&amp;nbsp; I took out my camera and began taking random pictures because I could, when all of a sudden, the librarian came swooping out of the woodwork.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"I see that you're taking pictures", she said.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Er, yes.", I said, rather startled.&amp;nbsp; "Is that ok?&amp;nbsp; I can stop if you'd like."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Oh, no!&amp;nbsp; It's quite alright.&amp;nbsp; Are you a librarian?", she inquired, excitedly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Well, no, but I have an extreme fascination with small libraries.", I lied.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Oh, that's absolutely wonderful!&amp;nbsp; Are you from a newspaper?"&amp;nbsp; she said, her left eye twitching wildly.&amp;nbsp; I was beginning to believe she might actually faint at this point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"No, no...I'm from...I'm from my school in Colorado.&amp;nbsp; I'm taking pictures of small Arizona libraries for my Senior project."&amp;nbsp; I said.&amp;nbsp; My web of lies was growing faster than my desire to keep the charade up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Well, be sure to sign our guest book up front.&amp;nbsp; And feel free to take as many pictures as you please!"&amp;nbsp; she exclaimed, and disappeared as fast as she came.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was relieved that she had decided to end the conversation at that point.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
A.&amp;nbsp; I could come up with more falsifications, and&lt;br /&gt;
B.&amp;nbsp; If I could keep from laughing any longer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Since I've gone on long enough about this library, how about the link to these aforementioned pictures?&amp;nbsp; You may find them &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/journey.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or you can always find this permanently on my &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Page.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And that's it, for I must save more verbiage for later on tonight.&amp;nbsp; I must cook up another blog for those who read late at night or early in the morning.&amp;nbsp; Again, sorry for the delay, and I hope that the pictures make up for it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Postscript: For a limited time, I will be offering these pictures for download in whatever size you need.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Please &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/contactus.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Contact Me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to request a size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
800x600&amp;nbsp; 1024x768&amp;nbsp; 1280x1024&amp;nbsp; 1600x1200&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Arizona summers are wearing on me in a way I didn't foresee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Luckily, the other two lenses are intact and in good health. &amp;nbsp;I took a lovely shot of the Gilbert LDS Temple the other day with the zoom lens on a beautiful rainy day that I just may post when I have the desire. &amp;nbsp;Until then, just know where I've been, and know that I am not paying the prescribed $440 that Apple wants for this repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Comparisons</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As it's still&lt;/b&gt; my birthday, I'll make this a brief entry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The wife and I ran all around town today, having all sorts of fun, and now we're ready to collapse for a few hours.&amp;nbsp; But I won't leave you all empty handed, oh no.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
What I have for you today is a &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/video/chicken.wmv"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; To clarify, a video of a chicken.&amp;nbsp; Yes yes, I know.&amp;nbsp; I beat things to death.&amp;nbsp; But I figure that when you have a theme, you ought to go with it.&amp;nbsp; It seems that the chicken was still around when we got home last night, even though promises were made for its safe retrieval.&amp;nbsp; For all I know, the poor guy is still cluckin' about outside, wondering how he got to be in this predicament.&amp;nbsp; He seemed to be quite worried when I approached him, to tell the truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So what was the prize for today?&amp;nbsp; The ultimate gift had to be the Star Trek box set.&amp;nbsp; That completes the collection at ten DVDs.&amp;nbsp; That's pretty happy news.&amp;nbsp; We sat down last night to watch the first one.&amp;nbsp; My wife had of course never seen the earlier Treks, and it had been quite a few years since I had viewed it, save maybe the last few minutes on some cable channel.&amp;nbsp; The only word I have to describe that first installment is odd.&amp;nbsp; Such a strange, odd show.&amp;nbsp; I like it, but there is just so much pomp and non-climatic chorus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
As I explained (or tried) to my wife, this movie arrived years after the final episode of the television series, so they intended the seven minute sequence of Kirk and Scotty soaring around the new Enterprise to be somewhat of a touching moment.&amp;nbsp; But now, watching the movie in 2004, it all feels a bit hokey, like they're making too much of a deal about the reunion and such.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You want to push the fast forward button to the action parts, but the movie is meant to be cerebral and platonic.&amp;nbsp; Needless today, we're moving right along to the latter movies with greater anticipation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So that's it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;The birthday is at an end, and by what I hear outside of my office window, the neighbors have reported that the chicken has taken roost just beyond their front porch.&amp;nbsp; That's fine, as he had previously staked out the seat of my scooter as his new home.&amp;nbsp; He decided against it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Perhaps he found it too familiar.....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

Who knows). &amp;nbsp;The main difference between this one and the other was the focus; where the flowers in the background here are in focus, the other picture simply had the main flower in focus with the background blurred out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;When pressed for the "why", one particular person said, "The picture I chose spoke to a sense of community. &amp;nbsp;It focused on the many, rather than the one". &amp;nbsp;I loved that, and wondered to myself if that's why the other people I spoke to also chose this picture. &amp;nbsp;There's often a common thread that runs through our lives, and I like to think the people closest to me have an enduring, visceral ability to empathize, and to look toward others and focus on their needs, wants, and doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;I'm a very lucky person to have these people around me.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Two year hiatus</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yeah. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;About that two year break?&amp;nbsp; Maybe I just really needed it.&amp;nbsp; What, with getting married, having a child, and cramming two years of school into one, there just wasn't enough time to sit down and give the site a good once-over.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
At least that is what I keep telling myself.&amp;nbsp; Not really convinced, for sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So when you decide &lt;/b&gt;to dive back into the Web site madness, is it best to work on &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site or maybe &lt;a href="http://www.infiniteaugust.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.laughingmatterproductions.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; I told you it was madness.&amp;nbsp; Complete nonsense too, as it appears.&amp;nbsp; Just cross as many fingers as you can spare; this could get messy and heavens, we don't need more messes around here, what with a two year old (almost) and all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Curious George.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;Very cute movie.&amp;nbsp; Overall, I would say they stayed extremely true to the concept of the mischievous monkey, if you would allow me the license to claim there is an underlying concept.&amp;nbsp; We took the aforementioned (almost) two year old to view the movie.&amp;nbsp; Dang AMC with their previews that begin at the starting time.&amp;nbsp; I must have gotten used to Harkins.&amp;nbsp; It seems obvious to begin the previews before the start time.&amp;nbsp; Sumner started getting really squeemish right around the third preview.&amp;nbsp; At the beginning of the 5th preview, well; he was almost begging for "monkey".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And as much as possible, I believe the little tike enjoyed it.&amp;nbsp; So much so, that when the movie ended, his lips curled into the saddest frown you can possibly imagine.&amp;nbsp; I was really wondering whether he was actually going to turn on the waterworks, but no further did i wonder than when he began wailing.&amp;nbsp; Monkey!&amp;nbsp; MONKEEEEEEEE!&amp;nbsp; NEEEEED MONKEEEEEEEE!&amp;nbsp; And so on.&amp;nbsp; Thank goodness my wife found a promotional Curious George movie poster inside the mall moments later.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, we would have had to go buy more tickets and sit there again.&amp;nbsp; Don't think the thought didn't cross my mind.&amp;nbsp; Oh, it did.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And that's it for now.&amp;nbsp; Off to bed, no posts this weekend, it's time to get the site cleaned up and ready for official launch later this month.&amp;nbsp; Take care!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>When I originally commented I clicked the &amp;quot;Notify me when new comments are added&amp;quot; checkbox and now each time a 
comment is added I get four emails with the same comment.
Is there any way you can remove me from that service?
Thanks!

    <title>Stolen</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life is full of nasty habits.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Writing happens to cover a large portion of those habits.&amp;nbsp; While one week may bring you infinite possibilities for literature, another may be extremely dry.&amp;nbsp; Thus, bringing you swiftly out of the swing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
No room for complaint, and I sure can't imagine a better provider of content that the week past.&amp;nbsp; In fact, a close friend of mine mentioned that the resultant episodes of this week would provide great blog-fodder.&amp;nbsp; I reluctantly agreed; however, I knew that I wouldn't have the heart or the energy to describe my thoughts until later.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
On Monday morning, I left for work as I usually do.&amp;nbsp; I walked into my office in the same manner I always have, and I sat down at my desk in no unusual fashion.&amp;nbsp; Two hours drifted by without much ado, and I prepared for my break without much anticipation.&amp;nbsp; But then, as I began my ordinary break, my wife called me with some extraordinary news.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Our car had been stolen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
At first, I thought she was joking.&amp;nbsp; But as I listened, I detected the firm disposition that this was, in fact, no gag at all.&amp;nbsp; Our car had truly been stolen overnight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I then proceeded to return home to help my wife with telephone calls to the police, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
During the trip home, many thoughts passed through my mind.&amp;nbsp; First and foremost was the hope that the car was truly gone for good.&amp;nbsp; If you're car gets stolen, and you have no deep love for this car in the first place, this would be the normal knee-jerk reaction that one would have.&amp;nbsp; And this was definitely the strongest emotion that I was feeling at the time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I also thought about all of the belongings in the car.&amp;nbsp; What did we have in there?&amp;nbsp; Did we leave any checks?&amp;nbsp; Any credit cards?&amp;nbsp; When did it get stolen?&amp;nbsp; Why hadn't I noticed that earlier?&amp;nbsp; Did I lock the doors?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After a few telephone calls to police departments, insurance adjusters, and apartment management, we felt that we had all in hand.&amp;nbsp; I returned to work, nevertheless I was now wired.&amp;nbsp; My mind raced at a million mile rate.&amp;nbsp; The desire to have this car permanently gone swelled within me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Much later that night, as the wife and I were tucked away into bed, we resigned ourselves to the fact that what was, will be.&amp;nbsp; However, just as that decision was reached, the telephone rang.&amp;nbsp; I leapt from the bedside to recover my cell phone in the next room.&amp;nbsp; It was officer anybody.&amp;nbsp; At this moment in time, I knew that there were two distinct possibilities:&amp;nbsp; One, my car was found in a burning heap on the side of the road or two, my car has been found and I can come get it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sadly, the latter proved to be the case.&amp;nbsp; And many of you may be thinking, why would he want his car to be gone that badly.&amp;nbsp; I can't answer the question, because I feel sick that I thought that way.&amp;nbsp; My desire to have a new car was seriously jeopardizing my rational.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Now, four days later I can say that I'm glad that the car is back.&amp;nbsp; To be without all of the hassle with the insurance and researching cars is a satisfying feeling afterall.&amp;nbsp; Lesson learned?&amp;nbsp; Buy any car-theft deterrent device that you can reasonably afford.&amp;nbsp; Even if you think that no one on earth would want your car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On a lighter note&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; I believe that I know why the car was returned.&amp;nbsp; Almost every Sunday night, we hit "E" on our gas tank.&amp;nbsp; The car thief jacked the car, saw the needle, and said to heck with it and ditched it.&amp;nbsp; One quarter of a mile away from our house.&amp;nbsp; :)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>3/24/2009 - Hackbook?</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;I ordered myself &lt;/strong&gt;a new Dell Mini 9 "Netbook" today with the money I had been saving from my birthday.  They had a great deal going at only $199, though I did choose a few small upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ship date isn't until mid-April, so I'm not holding my breath for a quick arrival.  But when it does get here, I'm removing Linux and installing OS X.  It should be a fun adventure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/02/mini9_hackintosh_8.jpg" alt="What mine will (hopefully) look like" width="482" height="346" /&gt;</content>

    <content type='html'>Sounds like you inherited your &amp;quot;campability&amp;quot; from me.  (The curse of genetics.)
At least you kept a sense of humour.
Nice piece.

    <title>Books</title>
    <content type='html'>So I lied, and I will write a little bit tonight. I felt a little adventurous tonight and drove to Barnes and Noble. Looking at my collection of books, i think i must have read them all at least twice, if not a good number of times more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One thing about my book reading habits is that i rarely tread outside the comfort zone that i have built in my readings. It's either sci-fi or straight fiction. So tonight, while perusing the sci-fi section, i found a book (with the help of my friend Heather) called Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Why is has two writers, i don't really know, but it perked my interest because of New York Times' quotable..."A direct descendant of The Hitch hikers Guide to the Galaxy". Bam. Sold me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, i also bought the Star Wars trilogy. &amp;nbsp; I had to. &amp;nbsp;I have it in my blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'll be going to disneyland again this weekend, again i say, the last time i was there was in March and oh boy what fun i had...i went on zero rides and spent a grand total of 3 hours there. Let's hope they aren't renovating half of the rides this time around. But hey, as long as Star Tours is open, i'm happy as a clam. (in my blood, star wars is...)Well see if i can get some pictures up. We'll see. I may have already doomed myself, having made that statement. We'll see.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and whatever you do, don't see Men in Black II. It's very...not good. Extremely opposite of goodness. The antithesis of well made and thought out movies. That is all.</content>

    <title>Camping II</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Every good story deserves a sequel.&amp;nbsp; Five years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/archives/061206.htm" target="_blank"&gt;I wrote what some consider to be a good story&lt;/a&gt; about a star-crossed camping trip.&amp;nbsp; I described it as “...not a long story, ...filled with happiness, embarrassment, laughter, disappointment, steak, and 150 miles of driving.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;If that story was Home Alone, this is Home Alone 2.&amp;nbsp; Except with less steak.&amp;nbsp; So sit back and cast your thoughts aside for a few moments while I entertain you with another adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4nEpsnoq1n_NCskiDXPd3HhPhPmKmKkZw4Yf628835QnqzfKDazPUGVXR1yYWYbW4U29mACzZkHe5DGZWh5bwpWqOJNxEFtPHZkpB6aPtXEGtQbr9F8vwpDxG27oV-XMjfziW/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-11-28+at+12.51.09+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4nEpsnoq1n_NCskiDXPd3HhPhPmKmKkZw4Yf628835QnqzfKDazPUGVXR1yYWYbW4U29mACzZkHe5DGZWh5bwpWqOJNxEFtPHZkpB6aPtXEGtQbr9F8vwpDxG27oV-XMjfziW/s320/Screen+Shot+2011-11-28+at+12.51.09+PM.png" width="99" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We had planned this trip for a long time.&amp;nbsp; When I say, “plan”, you might conjure up in your mind such descriptors as “outline”, “schedule”, “purpose”, or even “call ahead to see if they allow overnight camping”.&amp;nbsp; No. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;When I say we planned it, I mean Daniel Dawson and I desired to go camping.&amp;nbsp; Greatly desired.&amp;nbsp; We simply wanted to drive to the desert, light a fire, grill some steak, get some rest, and shoot some photos.&amp;nbsp; You know, camping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;After finally setting a date, Daniel and I split some basic responsibilities and necessities and met on a Friday afternoon.&amp;nbsp; We piled everything up in the trusty van, and set off northward toward the Needle Rock area, which was the spot of many camping adventures in the past, including the ill-fated camping trip of 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We thought we were so well prepared.&amp;nbsp; We had our tent, steak, our “trundle” of wood (as christened by me, it being three bundles of wood) and plenty of daylight.&amp;nbsp; We should have realized our night’s true destiny then, when we pulled up to the Needle Rock entrance and saw pavement instead of a dirt trail.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the forest service had taken hold of this land, paved it, and blessed it with bathrooms.&amp;nbsp; And wanted money for the experience.&amp;nbsp; Permits required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;No matter!&amp;nbsp; Onward and forward we thought, pulling into the well-manicured campground, loveingly named “Needle Rock Campground”.&amp;nbsp; Our first stop was a parking lot, where we found our second revelatory hindrance; a “No Overnight Camping” sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAqPTjFRKrS2UXkPl48T0faEwwFtmN0rI590BdQw5Ys4rMGqkoiswAU5L6AIJUhIruneTviev8UhNvre1wnePghUmikf4oFDJMWFweNm8Oi_NZZeXomLyjf_1Mza26BbclLzOx/s1600/IMG_2398.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAqPTjFRKrS2UXkPl48T0faEwwFtmN0rI590BdQw5Ys4rMGqkoiswAU5L6AIJUhIruneTviev8UhNvre1wnePghUmikf4oFDJMWFweNm8Oi_NZZeXomLyjf_1Mza26BbclLzOx/s200/IMG_2398.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Allow me a brief diversion; does not the word “camping” denote the overnight variety?&amp;nbsp; Forgive me if I lack the intellectual fortitude to fully grasp the mountain man’s vision of camping, but when I say, “I’m going camping” to someone, you better believe they’re thinking I’m not coming back until at least the next day.&amp;nbsp; Hmm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;So, thus disenchanted but never discouraged by our discovery, we decided to take the first unpaved road we saw and forage our way ahead to see what else we could find.&amp;nbsp; Not even 100 yards on this path we met our third hiccup in the night’s affairs by nearly getting my front-wheel drive family mini-van stuck in some nasty sand.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, it lasted only a moment, and we turned back, proverbial tail between our legs, a nasty taste of deja vu in our mouths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;As I had AT&amp;amp;T and had ventured outside of my 25-foot grace period of the city limits, my phone would do us no good as we turned to the Internet for help in our search for suitable camping arrangements for the evening.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, Daniel had Verizon and was somehow pulling down about 5mbps out in the boonies, so we quickly confirmed our fate at the current campground and headed south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;After several unanswered phone calls to family members resulted in a quick Google search.&amp;nbsp; As good fortune would have it, there was another campground only three miles to shy of us called McDowell Mountain.&amp;nbsp; It seemed a literal utopian paradise for us; we were wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;A few hundred yards from the entrance to the park, I noticed something awry.&amp;nbsp; Another snag in the fibers of the night.&amp;nbsp; There was a line of cars, campers, and trucks waiting to get in.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it was a holiday weekend, but still...a line of near 50 vehicles seemed hardly warranted at this point.&amp;nbsp; When you’re faced with this unfortunate set of circumstances, you have very little choice.&amp;nbsp; You pull in and mark your spot in line, noticing that no one is being turned away.&amp;nbsp; Faithfully, you dig in, and wait.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIXGCrf1PX-Bfo4pG63Exb7ePTNy7Tk-mLCE6vtEUBV8_HVy1qlmVNc3WlXGldyXJyBFSK03-TP-XOdvfKrU9uxJNJwPAtFU1pxzx4oMy2JHZccGbUN6h-MGcr0Ppn4cqYYafp/s1600/IMG_2399.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIXGCrf1PX-Bfo4pG63Exb7ePTNy7Tk-mLCE6vtEUBV8_HVy1qlmVNc3WlXGldyXJyBFSK03-TP-XOdvfKrU9uxJNJwPAtFU1pxzx4oMy2JHZccGbUN6h-MGcr0Ppn4cqYYafp/s200/IMG_2399.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I turned to Daniel about 20 minutes into our queue and revealed to him what only I could see past the careening sequence of autos; a “Campground Full” sign.&amp;nbsp; I was flabbergasted.&amp;nbsp; How could this be?&amp;nbsp; We were still 10 cars back at least, and no one was driving the opposite direction from us.&amp;nbsp; There had to be a mistake.&amp;nbsp; Fate could not possibly hold such unmitigated sway over our endeavors. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;The sun setting before our very eyes, we had little options.&amp;nbsp; After a few more excruciating minutes in line, we pulled up to a very congenial looking gentleman.&amp;nbsp; Pleasantly, he glanced in the car at us and said, “You running?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I was perplexed.&amp;nbsp; Did he think us fugitives, evading the law at the nearest 45 minutes line of cars we could find?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Are you running?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Ex..excuse me?”, I stammered.&amp;nbsp; I could no longer hide my utter confusion at this curveball of a conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Are you racing this weekend?”, he blustered back.&amp;nbsp; Consternation knit my brow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“No..no..We’re camping.&amp;nbsp; Camping.&amp;nbsp; We want to camp.”&amp;nbsp; I could only muster the vocabulary of an eight year old at that point.&amp;nbsp; There was a lump in my throat.&amp;nbsp; Tunnel vision clouded my processes.&amp;nbsp; Daniel laughed and guffawed at my side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;

&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Oh, you’re serious,” he said, looking very sympathetic.&amp;nbsp; “I’m sorry.&amp;nbsp; You’ve waited for nothing.&amp;nbsp; We’re full." &amp;nbsp;He stammered a bit; shuffling his feet for stability.&amp;nbsp; "We don’t have anything for you.&amp;nbsp; We’re holding the Ironman Triathlon here this weekend.&amp;nbsp; I’m so sorry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;

&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I don’t recall very well what I said next. For all I know, it was probably a few hesitated inflections about how I really just wanted a place to grill some steak.&amp;nbsp; Nonplussed, the gentleman carried on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“You know, if you drive not four miles to the North, there’s a campground there you can stay at.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“We know”, we said nearly in unison.&amp;nbsp; “We just came from there.&amp;nbsp; There’s no overnight camping allowed anymore.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Well, that’s unfortunate.&amp;nbsp; I just sent a few others there this evening.&amp;nbsp; Look, do you know where the Bush Highway is?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;

&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I said I did not know where that was, when clearly, I knew where it was.&amp;nbsp; My thoughts were with those other poor souls who were sent to Needlerock.&amp;nbsp; Our eyes glazed over with disillusion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;

&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;He pushed on.&amp;nbsp; “You just gotta drive south through Fountain Hills, get to the Beeline and take that north to the Bush Highway.&amp;nbsp; It’s the Saguaro Del Norte recreation area.&amp;nbsp; You drive down that road and you’ll be damned sure to find a place to camp there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We looked at each other for a brief moment to communicate our thoughts, turned back toward the man and issued our gratitude for his help.&amp;nbsp; Flummoxed, we took our adventure southward again, toward the Fountain Hills area and ultimately the Bush Highway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Hysteria and delirium clobbered the van at that point.&amp;nbsp; How could we be afflicted yet again with such a destiny? Did the fates hold anything for us?&amp;nbsp; Would we be able to grill any steak?&amp;nbsp; Read on, dear readers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We faced a decision.&amp;nbsp; With our allotment of daylight dwindling rapidly, and no clear destination in mind, did we push forth and try to find a suitable spot?&amp;nbsp; Careening through the rolling streets of Fountain Hills gave us plenty of time to both decide and complain.&amp;nbsp; By the time we reached Shea Blvd, we had made up our minds.&amp;nbsp; We knew our destiny, and it smelled like steak seasoning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Peeling out while turning to the East on Shea, the fearless Odyssey minivan showing its true colors and passion to its occupants, we headed toward the Bush Highway.&amp;nbsp; Headlights on, we kept our eyes peeled for any clues that might show us the way.&amp;nbsp; Turning left on what seemed like a good location, we discovered only a pier that led to the lake. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted the small Lakeshore Restaurant.&amp;nbsp; Daniel bade me to ask someone for directions.&amp;nbsp; Spotting a woman on a golf cart, I drove up to her and sheepishly asked her whether there was a place to camp nearby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;She said there wasn’t, and we both lowered our heads in disbelief.&amp;nbsp; Quickly she corrected herself however, remembering that it was in fact November, and the Park Service allowed camping along the shore of the Salt River until March.&amp;nbsp; We simply needed to keep following the road until we found the Water Users Camping area, and hike on down to the shore.&amp;nbsp; We finally felt a brief moment of relief and hope.&amp;nbsp; Thanking the woman, we left her and made our trek back to the highway. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Light had all but left us at that point.&amp;nbsp; Following the woman’s precise directions, we located the parking lot that would allow us passage to the shores of the Salt River.&amp;nbsp; Letting the headlights be our guide, we passed back and forth while deciding which spot would bring us closer to the campsite. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Unexpectedly, a small animal darted in front of the van, eyes ablaze as its tapetum lucidum reflected our headlights back at us.&amp;nbsp; Daniel freaked; he screamed and beckoned me to stop.&amp;nbsp; After discovering it to be a lost kitten, we discarded our man-cards and parked on the North end of the lot. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was time to investigate this campsite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;It should be mentioned that we had stocked immensely for the night.&amp;nbsp; Tents, sleeping bags, chairs, wood, a grill, a cooler, and other odds and ends that would prove difficult to carry down to the river in one trip.&amp;nbsp; We decided that we had better take a trip sans supplies, just to see if we could even find a suitable location.&amp;nbsp; After all, the sky had darkened and time was a luxury we did not have.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Once down at the shore, we realized the last damning fact that sealed our fate.&amp;nbsp; Every square inch of the area was covered in broken glass.&amp;nbsp; There was no chance of camping here.&amp;nbsp; While our tetanus shots were both up to date, the thought of dealing with those shards helped speed our decision to simply make a fire, grill the steak, and get home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Home.&amp;nbsp; We remembered at this point that Daniel’s car was 50 miles away, parked in the lot of an AJ’s Fine Foods.&amp;nbsp; Our nightly adventure had taken us quite a few miles out of our original path. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I digress.&amp;nbsp; After a few runs to the car, we placed our “trundle” of wood inside a hastily crafted fire ring, and begun the process of heating the coals for the grill.&amp;nbsp; With our chairs set up, Daniel and I had a few minutes to ruminate on the night’s transpiring.&amp;nbsp; We could hardly believe that we fell victim to another night of gallivanting about the Valley in search of a place to camp. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;With the steak cooking on the grill, Daniel took out the potatoes that his dear wife had carefully wrapped in aluminum foil for us to cook.&amp;nbsp; He dug a couple small holes a few inches deep, set in each a hot coal, placed the wrapped potato on top of the coal, and placed three more; one on top, and one on each side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Quizzically, I inquired with Daniel whether he thought that would cook the potatoes.&amp;nbsp; “Just set a timer”, he said.&amp;nbsp; He was quite sure that in less than an hour, we would have wonderfully cooked steamy fresh potatoes for our culinary enjoyment.&amp;nbsp; So we set the timer, and carried on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;A few minutes later, Daniel whisked around in his chair, alarmed, aiming his flashlight into the distance. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Did you hear something?” he asked.&amp;nbsp; I responded to him nonchalantly, stating that I hadn’t heard a thing, and for him to stop scaring me.&amp;nbsp; This was the second time that night that he was roused by something, and his predilection for theatre was quite amusing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“I swear I heard something.&amp;nbsp; Right behind me.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;After a few minutes of swinging the lights to and fro, we concluded that we were not being harassed by coyotes, javelina, bobcats, mountain lions, or raccoons.&amp;nbsp; A few times we did hear some fish jumping out of the water, which as time went on became the tidings of mer-people during their nightly dalliance. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;The steak was delicious, if not a bit over-seasoned by yours truly.&amp;nbsp; The conversation shifted from the serious to the insane, from intense to jocular, and we hardly remembered the potatoes that were surely ready to eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Carefully, Daniel dusted the coals from on top of the wrappings, and carefully peeled back the aluminum bundling.&amp;nbsp; I did the same. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We looked at each other. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Is your potato stone-cold?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“Yeah.&amp;nbsp; Yours too?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;For some reason, common sense so intensely illuminated our minds at the same time, that we almost fell out of our chairs for the pain of it.&amp;nbsp; How did we ever expect a huge potato to cook with four coals?&amp;nbsp; We could hardly stop laughing, when suddenly, Daniel whipped around again like on a swivel chair. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“I don’t”, I replied.&amp;nbsp; “What did you see?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Eyes.&amp;nbsp; Something’s hunting us.&amp;nbsp; I saw its eyes over there.&amp;nbsp; You can’t hear it?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;I paused, shuffled my feet for stability, and perked my ears to the scene.&amp;nbsp; It took a moment, but then I heard it.&amp;nbsp; Rustling in the branches, small footsteps on the underbrush.&amp;nbsp; Something was hunting us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“What was it?&amp;nbsp; Did you get a good look at it?&amp;nbsp; Should we leave?”, I asked, hesitantly.&amp;nbsp; I realized at that moment that neither of us could make a quick getaway.&amp;nbsp; Besides, what could really be stalking us at that moment?&amp;nbsp; Were we in peril?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;We listened further, but no further auditory revelations were offered. After tossing a few rocks of humane warning into the trees and nearby foliage, we assured ourselves that we were safe, and that the night could go on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Tossing the potatoes inside of the smoldering fire proved much more effective than our previous effort, and within 15 minutes, we had us some taters to eat.&amp;nbsp; More light conversation ensued, and we hardly remembered our previous dance with the unknown adversary. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;An adversary which was, my friends, quite real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Daniel again caught him with eager senses afire, shooting around in his seat so quick that his red hair was a blur.&amp;nbsp; Our flashlights found the target immediately; a pair of eyes in the distance, flickering and reflecting the light back at us, piercing, foraging, waiting.&amp;nbsp; It disappeared for only a moment, and was back in a flash, nearly 10 feet from its previous position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;

&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“No, it’s not”, Daniel replied.&amp;nbsp; He seemed much more sure of himself than I was. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;With his certainty placing the seed of doubt so firmly in my mind, my flashlight shifted from left to right, sweeping for its target. &amp;nbsp; It only took a few more moments before we found our antagonist again. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;“It’s a raccoon!”, bellowed Daniel. Indeed it was, and it had given us quite the scare.&amp;nbsp; But enough was enough, and we tossed a few well-aimed rocks in his direction to give him a final send off.&amp;nbsp; With Mr. Procyon lotor gone on his merry way, we returned to normal, but with a heightened sense of our surroundings.&amp;nbsp; And I certainly listened to Daniel when he thought he heard something. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;The rest of the evening was spent taking pictures and telling stories, until the hour grew late and we broke camp and put out the fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3Xv8om3kCr1MT_fzfD_aj4WJjPdzDQshDGp1IfTed1g081at4Xs1WOVs2v0r3qMsYhNFZQbEVWXlbA75_wUI48b4TIBFh02ajiErajU4THv_hVhI4UORHfVeGxOA9IbZ3FfD7/s1600/IMG_2412.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="149" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3Xv8om3kCr1MT_fzfD_aj4WJjPdzDQshDGp1IfTed1g081at4Xs1WOVs2v0r3qMsYhNFZQbEVWXlbA75_wUI48b4TIBFh02ajiErajU4THv_hVhI4UORHfVeGxOA9IbZ3FfD7/s200/IMG_2412.JPG" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Oh, and a note about putting out the fire; it’s never a good idea to urinate on top of a flaming hot 45 LB rock.&amp;nbsp; Cast your mind if you will, and imagine the stench of a locker room.&amp;nbsp; Now, make it 1000x worse.&amp;nbsp; That’s the smell of instantly vaporized urine.&amp;nbsp; It’s horrifying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;In my last ill-fated story about camping, I concluded by tale by stating that I would do it all again in a heartbeat.&amp;nbsp; That’s why we went, really.&amp;nbsp; Even if you had told us going in that we would be beset on every turn by every imagination of obstruction, we would have sallied forth with dogged determination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; min-height: 14.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Like before, this lengthy travelogue certainly does not do the evening enough justice.&amp;nbsp; As they say, you just had to be there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>They got a pepper bar!</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I've got&lt;/b&gt; Ben Folds playing in the background, the latest beta test is downloading slowly, so let us begin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm not going to beat around the bush.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;GREATEST COMMERCIAL EVER&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And just what is the greatest commercial, you ask?&amp;nbsp; None other than Quizno's strange spong monkey spots. If you haven't yet viewed these, you may view them both &lt;a href="http://www.quiznos.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The basic premise is fairly standard; these small furry mysteries attempt to get you talking about their commercial.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It begins with one furry creature singing a crazy song about their subs, a bowler hat atop his (her?) head, while their friend is in the upper corner with an 18th century sailor's hat plucking away at a guitar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sure, the voice is funny.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the little creatures are&amp;nbsp; amusing.&amp;nbsp; But the greatest part of this commercial, the part that absolutely makes me double over laughing on the floor, it the part where there is a longer pause, followed by the line "They got a pepper bar!"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I don't know what a pepper bar is, I don't really care, but this commercial has me sold.&amp;nbsp; I'm going, first chance I get.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And by the way, just in case you're wondering what a "spong monkey" is, it's a creation from the United Kingdom that appeared on the Net a little while ago and became a pop culture icon there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And yes, either you love this commercial, or you hate it.&amp;nbsp; But I belong to the former group.&amp;nbsp; I have to give this ad an "A".&amp;nbsp; I think that they should market a stuffed animal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In other news&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp; I've decided to do something drastic to get my daily visits up.&amp;nbsp; I haven't decided just what that's going to be, but there's been quite a drop off in visits this month.&amp;nbsp; Sure, I could attribute that to the fact that I haven't been writing, but I'll be naive and just assume that everyone is bored with the same old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Will it be music?&amp;nbsp; Will it be pictures?&amp;nbsp; A new story? &lt;a href="http://www.outsidetheworld.com/poll.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Let's take a vote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>9/11</title>
    <content type='html'>Rather than create a new entry today, I would like to share a post I wrote exactly one year after 9/11 occurred. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To me, it more fully explains what was lost and found that day. It seems more focused in its intent and spirit; certainly more so than what I could write today. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The past 10 years have filtered through my soul like the cascading flow of a waterfall. What's below the tumult and chaos of the surface remains unchanged and steadfast. Reposting this essay on my thoughts that anniversary allows me to peek below to the experiences that made me who I am today. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I repost without changes, everything intact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
--------------&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9/11/2002&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God grant that I can say the right words here…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve been debating this for weeks now. Whether to mark this day with my own words or not. Every time I caught a glimpse of today’s date I would get a little uneasy in my seat, uncomfortable in my own body. Maybe it was that I myself had forgotten. Maybe, it was the uncertainty that still laid hold of my mind at times. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a somber day. It’s a day of quiet reflection, as it should be for all Americans, for the whole world. I can never forget how naked I felt that day, even in the midst of the strongest mountains of the Rockies, I felt strangely exposed. The connections that held me to each person that I knew were shattered; at once, I felt alone. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn’t convince myself to drive down the canyon after work. I couldn’t pull myself away from the news. My soul was numb; my hands felt like they weren’t my own. I walked outside to the south side of the resort. Looking up at the great mountains beside me, I &lt;br /&gt;
said a silent prayer for those who were lost. I called my mother and heard her trembling voice as she kept saying “no, it’s not possible”. My mother realized it, the world had changed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had to listen to my sister cry as I told her to turn the TV on. I should have let her sleep. I wanted her to be a world away from me, in a different time where she wouldn’t have to see the flames and the blood. But she too, lived in this world on the morning of &lt;br /&gt;
September 11th, 2001. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could hear Allie in the background, she was up, and she was playing. My niece had no idea how the world was changing. All she knew was she was safe; she had her mother there beside her to take care of her. She was feeling what I wish I could. I believe now, upon silent recollection, that it was my young niece that pulled me away from that scene. She was the thing that could bring me back to the world I knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I called my brother Adam, whose voice had always been one of reason and calming for me in my life. As expected, nothing had changed there, he could still comfort me but I could sense a strange transition in his demeanor. I asked how his class was handling the day, he said they were scared, confused, angry, all of the emotions which we were all feeling in the aftermath of the attack on our country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, I felt the connections to my family and friends come back to me, I felt a little more whole. Maybe it was hearing their voices that brought harmony to my soul. And as I sit here, one full year later, I am thankful that I feel not only like myself again, but more of a man than I was before that day. I was given the chance to grow &lt;br /&gt;
up in the world, not to let it shape me but to refine; I take the greatest elements of what life is and incorporate them. I see how the world has done just that, I see the attitudes of a million &lt;br /&gt;
Americans standing in solidarity, proclaiming with one voice, “we will never forget”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And may God grant that we never will, one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

I snapped 14 pictures along the way. &lt;p&gt;I returned inside to look at them. I always hope for that gem; the one print that says something to me, or the one that looks brilliant, despite the circumstances. &lt;p&gt;None of the 14 yesterday really did, though. But after showing a friend at work, he and I both agreed that this one fit the cliche postcard look nicely enough. And since it&amp;#39;s been several days since I&amp;#39;ve posted, it made the cut. &lt;p&gt;So, enjoy the exposure, little palm-tree-with-wispy-clouds picture. You wouldn&amp;#39;t have made it on any other day. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Buckhorst H1&lt;br&gt;Film: DreamCanvas</content>

    <title>XBOX 360</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'm still &lt;/b&gt;getting used to the updates.&amp;nbsp; You'll have to excuse me while I attempt to locate my routine in all of this.&amp;nbsp; You'll also have to excuse me if this entry gets a little open ended and meandering.&amp;nbsp; I'm watching/listening to Winnie the Pooh for the Nth time this weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Wife and I had a rather enjoyable weekend together, although not much was truly accomplished.&amp;nbsp; Friday night we decided to rent a video game and eat frozen pizza at home while the 'rents watched our boy.&amp;nbsp; Turns out Blockbuster nixed our membership a while back; they wanted us to spend a little while and fill out their application.&amp;nbsp; It didn't take much for me to turn my back on that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, we ended up still eating cold pizza, but instead of a video game, we went grocery shopping.&amp;nbsp; Fair trade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Saturday was spent seeing family and friends.&amp;nbsp; My buddy Neal and I drove around in the never ending rain.&amp;nbsp; I received a free burger coupon from Red Robin for my birthday, and seeing how that is one of our favorite eating establishments, we dropped by late in the evening to pay them a visit.&amp;nbsp; However, 45 octogenarians decided to spoil that event by attempting to seat themselves at the aforementioned restaurant five minutes before we arrived.&amp;nbsp; Harrumph.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I never did&lt;/b&gt; give a report on my birthday now, did I?&amp;nbsp; What a tremendous day.&amp;nbsp; Kudos indeed to my beautiful wife for managing to procure an XBOX 360 AND not tell me about it.&amp;nbsp; She's always had a hard time keeping surprises from me, bless her heart; I could tell how excited she was when I finally opened that present up last.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And my, that 360 is quite a beast.&amp;nbsp; Forget whatever reviews you may have read online.&amp;nbsp; You really have to see it to believe it.&amp;nbsp; The craftsmanship inside and out is amazing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The wife also crafted me a wonderful scrapbook detailing our marriage up to this point.&amp;nbsp; Actually, that is my favorite present that she gave me.&amp;nbsp; That particular present is holding semi-permanent residence on my desk at work, for those particular times when I'm in need of a good pick me up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Another fun happening on my birthday was a rather rousing Web camera session with my brother and his seven kids.&amp;nbsp; Technology can be quite a blessing; this instance in particular.&amp;nbsp; I was actually able to watch and hear each one of them sing "Happy Birthday" to me.&amp;nbsp; Sumner quite enjoyed it too.&amp;nbsp; He's at that point in his life where most things are magic.&amp;nbsp; I'm going to like this phase, and truly will be sad when it nears its end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
There have been more updates to &lt;a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bloggenpucky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.codesanctuary.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Code Sanctuary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; be sure to give them a peek.&amp;nbsp; Eric is outdoing himself with coding and such.&amp;nbsp; You'd have to be&amp;nbsp; true geek to appreciate the in's and out's.&amp;nbsp; Oh, by the way, Code Sanctuary is what was formerly known as The Difference of Opinion Web site, which died long ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And look!&amp;nbsp; My old St. Patrick's day banner image is back.&amp;nbsp; That should be fun to use for a little while, at least.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Yeah, that's all.&amp;nbsp; Have a great week!&amp;nbsp; More to come, says I.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Songs I heard</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This past weekend was &lt;/b&gt;one of those that passed quickly.&amp;nbsp; For example, when Sunday night rolls around, you tend you ask yourself what you accomplished, and the only thing you can think of is eating mac and cheese for dinner.&amp;nbsp; Sure, there was other stuff, but that was all filler, right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Of course, I did create quite a few entries for the ol' Moblah'g on Saturday, which was a lot of fun.&amp;nbsp; The boy and I decided we had enough of lounging around the house that morning, and skipped out at around quarter to noon.&amp;nbsp; I'll openly admit that I couldn't face the iPhone's launch sitting down; I had to see it for myself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/and.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Like I mentioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a previous post, I'm mostly impressed with the quality of the gadget.&amp;nbsp; The software is great too, with the exception of that darn keyboard.&amp;nbsp; Most say that it is something that can be gotten used to, I say I may not ever want to.&amp;nbsp; I like the keyboard on my Treo fine, thank you kindly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Mobile blogging is truly a blast though, even if no one hardly reads it on the weekend.&amp;nbsp; I wish I could go all over the place and do it for a living.&amp;nbsp; I'd do it tomorrow, except my family needs food more than words.&amp;nbsp; Oh, if only these words could earn money.&amp;nbsp; Someday, maybe.&amp;nbsp; Today?&amp;nbsp; Not a chance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I often wonder &lt;/b&gt;what Sumner thinks of all the time I spend here in my office.&amp;nbsp; He's only a lad of three, so he probably doesn't think much of it.&amp;nbsp; Lately much of my free time has been consumed by the Web site, as happens from time to time...and occasionally he'll saunter in and ask me a few questions about why my Web site is blue (see, he has a supposed monopoly on all things blue, especially dark blue) and afterward, wander back into his room to play trucks or ninja turtles.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and that's another thing entirely.&amp;nbsp; Since when does my offspring play with my number one favorite toy of all time?&amp;nbsp; It just doesn't seem like that long has transpired since I bought my first turtle from Fred and Meyers back in '87.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Ah, but I gave myself away, didn't I?&amp;nbsp; It was a long, long time ago.&amp;nbsp; Nearly 20 years, to my count.&amp;nbsp; The world was so much the same, but so much is different now.&amp;nbsp; If you take time to consider it though, it's overwhelming how much is comparable from a certain perspective.&amp;nbsp; It really provides a bit of comfort in this insanely fast paced world.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Excuse me.&amp;nbsp; It's 11:00pm and my son just hopped out of bed, and is playing with something on his bedroom floor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No sweat, I'm back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I opened the door and a small shadow flew past my field of view and dove back into the bed, dashing under the covers in the hopes that I may not have seen him.&amp;nbsp; It was amusing to behold, because I did the same thing so many times when I was his age.&amp;nbsp; Does nothing change with children?&amp;nbsp; It scares me what things in the future he will try to get away with while I'm not looking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I tucked him back into bed and told him that he had a big day ahead of him tomorrow, so he had better get a good night sleep.&amp;nbsp; He asked me if sleeping well would make him be a good boy, and I confirmed that he was already a very good boy, but sleeping would make him even better.&amp;nbsp; He smiled cheekily and with a wink told me that I was a good boy too.&amp;nbsp; Simple moments like those are what make Monday through Friday bearable, my friends.&amp;nbsp; Only a family can do that for you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbjkoAve2NkeiRYL963WhnXWU6vyFEOzSLcJEy7T-LflEZTLH4PNlBO0Me7Yzh_DqwrhYCNtGA-pS0dd06Tc8xyV5BvPricvImaHKkdZ3nhWSY_TRhQ-fn9JDmcqZHRZegtYW1/s1600/harryconnnick.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbjkoAve2NkeiRYL963WhnXWU6vyFEOzSLcJEy7T-LflEZTLH4PNlBO0Me7Yzh_DqwrhYCNtGA-pS0dd06Tc8xyV5BvPricvImaHKkdZ3nhWSY_TRhQ-fn9JDmcqZHRZegtYW1/s1600/harryconnnick.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What am I listening to&lt;/b&gt; right now?&amp;nbsp; It's actually one of the finest albums I own.&amp;nbsp; A definite favorite.&amp;nbsp; Highly recommended!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
When you're tired of listening to traditional children's music, the kind that repeats itself straight into your cerebellum and travels down your spinal cord until it buries yourself deep in your soul, then you'll welcome "Songs I Heard" with tears of overwhelming joy.&amp;nbsp; I could listen to this album for hours, and I have on more than one occasion.&amp;nbsp; Heck, I owned it well before I had Sumner and even before I married the Mrs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The selections from "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" are my absolute favorite.&amp;nbsp; It makes me realize that it was the music (and Gene Wilder, of course) that made that movie.&amp;nbsp; The new version with poor hapless Johnny Depp just doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid.&amp;nbsp; It's visual, sure...but it lacks that special quality and charm that the original was blessed with.&amp;nbsp; The first time I watched the Gene version was back in the early eighties, at my great-grandmother's funeral.&amp;nbsp; All of the parents placed the children under the watchful eyes of the television set while they enjoyed Jell-O with bananas embedded deep into its core.&amp;nbsp; Yes, those are RD's memories.&amp;nbsp; It's probably very, very false...but I was Sumner's age, I think.&amp;nbsp; And the Oompa Loompas scared me to tears.&amp;nbsp; Big surprise.&amp;nbsp; The sky is also blue and the sun is hot.&amp;nbsp; Johnny Depp is also a loon.&amp;nbsp; Just as obvious, to me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I have no &lt;/b&gt;idea why this blog's column is so insanely long, and I keep taking time out during writing to try and figure it out.&amp;nbsp; I've decided that's not a good idea, as I feel about 10 feet above the keyboard.&amp;nbsp; I'm hitting the backspace button about as many times as I did when I used the iPhone's virtual keyboard (zing!).&amp;nbsp; Probably time for me to head off to bed.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy your Monday!&amp;nbsp; More bloggage at the &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I'll see you there!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>"Starburys"</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Only the most twisted&lt;/b&gt; of minds substitutes work for work.&amp;nbsp; But that's just what I do, it seems.&amp;nbsp; It's almost a guarantee that I will begin working on this Web site (fun work) when I have a large job-related project to complete over the weekend (other work).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Just how much of my work-related project did I complete this weekend?&amp;nbsp; Not one bit.&amp;nbsp; But in related news, the Web site is coming along just peachy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A little weekend report &lt;/b&gt;seems to be in order, then.&amp;nbsp; Friday night signaled the long drive home from Phoenix to East Mesa, which has been made slightly easier by the discovery of a car pool buddy.&amp;nbsp; Isn't there another word for that?&amp;nbsp; "Buddy" just sounds "chummy".&amp;nbsp; Which also sounds weird.&amp;nbsp; This paragraph is getting circular.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Again, Friday night signaled the long drive home.&amp;nbsp; How long is it?&amp;nbsp; Long enough.&amp;nbsp; 45 miles, by my estimate.&amp;nbsp; I hardly need an estimate anymore, so I don't know why I said estimate.&amp;nbsp; I know it is exactly 44.6 miles from parking lot to garage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Friday night meant pizza night, and the best pizza for a broke family is from Little Caesars.&amp;nbsp; Only $5.00 purchases one fine meal.&amp;nbsp; With leftovers!&amp;nbsp; We've also recently discovered the convenience that home-delivered movies brings, courtesy of Blockbuster.&amp;nbsp; So we watched Mythbusters, of course.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Saturday was a jewel of a day.&amp;nbsp; From my friend Kyle, I learned about "Starburys", a line of shoes only available at &lt;a href="http://www.steveandbarrys.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Steve and Barry's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for only $14.98.&amp;nbsp; A fantastic deal, and not a bad shoe at that.&amp;nbsp; We drove down to the only Steve and Barry's store in the state (&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;q=desert+sky+mall&amp;amp;near=Phoenix,+AZ&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=0,0,3688905900232148494&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=image"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Desert Sky Mall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, *shudder*) and met my friend Jordan there.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, I did not let Kyle know what time we were to meet.&amp;nbsp; Go figure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I bought three pair.&amp;nbsp; My friend bought five.&amp;nbsp; When I went up to the counter to purchase, I was shocked to read the following. "LIMIT 10 PAIRS OF SHOES, PER PERSON, PER DAY.&amp;nbsp; THANK YOU."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Whoa, 10 pairs?&amp;nbsp; Who would buy 10 pairs of shoes at one time?&amp;nbsp; It seemed incredible to me, but then again, I was 1/3 of the way there, and I can imagine myself going back in a few months to pick up some newer styles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
After the purchase, the friends and I met back up at the park to break our shoes in.&amp;nbsp; I smiled to see that the court was empty; we'd have the entire place to ourselves.&amp;nbsp; Which worked out well, since we were all wearing the same shoes and looked a little geeky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
When I got out of the car, I remembered why the park was empty.&amp;nbsp; It's June, in Arizona, at 1:00pm.&amp;nbsp; It's 103 degrees in the shade.&amp;nbsp; Oh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But we played on anyway, pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shoes and growling whenever one of us stepped on each other's feet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The most interesting part of the day occurred while we were shooting around.&amp;nbsp; Two cars pulled up and parked alongside each other for a duration of 10 minutes, one passenger entering the other car for a moment before getting back in his ride and taking off.&amp;nbsp; This repeated two more times with a separate car, so naturally we got curious and began taking notice of the cars and their passengers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Another 15 minutes went by with all cars leaving, but remaining in the neighborhood, driving by every minute or so.&amp;nbsp; We quickly realized they were waiting for us to leave so that they could have their privacy doing gosh-knows-what.&amp;nbsp; I took a stab at it and figured they were dealing, so I called the cops.&amp;nbsp; We left a moment later, so I don't really know what happened.&amp;nbsp; I don't even know if they were dealing, but it seemed awfully suspicious to me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Sunday consisted of a few updates to the Web site, and this blog.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and a bike ride.&amp;nbsp; That was fun.&amp;nbsp; My legs feel like stretched bamboo poles, and ambulate much the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So, what's coming up?&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; It's June, which means The Police concert is approaching quickly.&amp;nbsp; The wife also begins working (for free), otherwise known as rotations.&amp;nbsp; Sumner also starts pre-school tomorrow morning.&amp;nbsp; That should be a blast to drop him off for the first time ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Wish us luck, we'll need it, eh?&amp;nbsp; See you soon.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Birth of the Moblah'g</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Monday evening, &lt;/b&gt;and a wonderful dip in the pool.&amp;nbsp; While we were swimming around, Sumner asked me one of those questions only children can ask.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Why are the clouds orange, daddy?"&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Funny how such a simple question can have such a complex answer to a child.&amp;nbsp; The sun reflects its light against the clouds in the evening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"But, the sun is yellow", he stated matter of factly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I then tried explaining that just as he sees himself in the mirror, the suns sees itself in the clouds.&amp;nbsp; That brought a smile to his face, and he resumed swimming.&amp;nbsp; Coincidentally, Sumner is an awesome swimmer, even better than he was last summer.&amp;nbsp; In previous years, he faced the pool and water with reckless abandon; he feared nothing about the entire event.&amp;nbsp; Seeing how he is more fully self-aware, I feared this summer would bring trepidation in full swing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But after two weeks of prescribed swimming lessons, the boy is nearly swimming the width of the pool.&amp;nbsp; Any pool in fact, just as long as there is water enough to jump in.&amp;nbsp; He lasts much longer than his parents, too...he doesn't know when to quit yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'm pretty stoked to announce&lt;/b&gt; a new addition to Outside the World: &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;nbsp; Go check it out, and come right back.&amp;nbsp; Don't worry, I'll wait right here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Back?&amp;nbsp; Good.&amp;nbsp; So the proper term is "MoBlog" (as in mobile blog), but I much prefer the Moblah'g.&amp;nbsp; I know it's been done thousands of times before by hundreds of thousands of people, but it's fun and why not, eh?&amp;nbsp; With this new blog, the site will be granted daily updates.&amp;nbsp; Everything comes straight from my smart phone, right as it happens.&amp;nbsp; It's my own little version of &lt;a href="http://www.buzz.mn/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;buzz.mn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I love the freedom that it gives me.&amp;nbsp; No longer is my mind tethered by my keyboard and mouse; I can post a picture and thoughts from anywhere I wish now.&amp;nbsp; Jeez, now that I think about it, this could be dangerous.&amp;nbsp; Well, with great power comes great responsibility, as one arachnid's uncle once said.&amp;nbsp; I'll do my best to entertain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, on the weekends, check the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/http://outsidetheworld.com/blog"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;main blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site for updates.&amp;nbsp; Any other day, head on over to &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;the Moblah'g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I'll be much appreciative of the effort!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As my brother pointed out,&lt;/b&gt; it is quite sad that I only know a song by "The Who" because I heard the reference on an episode of &lt;a href="http://ryandavid.blogspot.com/2007/06/simpsons.html"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"The Simpsons"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Well, it is what it is, as Rocky once said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
From the episode, "A Tale of Two Springfields":&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The various Who songs mentioned or played during this episode are: "My Generation", "Won't Get Fooled Again", "Squeeze Box" -Mentioned by Homer in the hotel.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Won't Get Fooled Again" was played later, as the group "broke" the wall.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"The Seeker" - Played at the start of the concert.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
"Magic Bus", "Pinball Wizard" - Requested by Homer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It was "Won't Get Fooled Again".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So, enjoy the new entries, &lt;/b&gt;and by all means, comment as you wish!&amp;nbsp; The only way I know that people are visiting this humble little blog is because of the commentary.&amp;nbsp; Plug away!&amp;nbsp; I leave you with the moon.&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type='html'>This is one of the things that work has over school.  Once you're done for the day, you're done.  There's no extra work that needs to be done while at home.  I love going home and being able to do what I want to do.</content>

Explain to these poor wildflowers how in Arizona, you can&amp;#39;t predict springtime weather. Tell them that yes, it was 85 degrees a week previous, and they were welcome to bloom. Then confess that it snowed. It snowed, and sapped the life from these poor tender blossoms. &lt;p&gt;A few days later, nature found equilibrium, and what remains is this damaged silhouette, drying in the setting 75&amp;#176; sun. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Tejas&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1935&lt;br&gt;Flash: Off</content>

    <title>Happy one-week to Outside...</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's been a weeks worth of writings and i'm feeling pretty good about the whole thing. Now, if i only knew how to archive these things i could make it so you wouldn't have to wait for a week's worth of writings to load. Oh well, i think it's just been one of those days, where nothing really made a whole lot of sense to me anyway. Even at work, whenever someone would ask me to do something, i would just look at them like they had 3 arms or as if they had just asked me to sprout wings and fly to the moon. I was supremely glad when 5 o clock rolled around. Oh wait, never mind, i left at 4:00. Yep, it was that long of a day...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Today when i was listening to the radio, the DJ said something that caught my attention. Apparently, someone has decided to create a statue memorial out of the now-famous picture of the three New York Firefighters hoisting the American flag over the rubble of the World Trade Center. I thought that was great. Then came this, that due to political correctness, they were going to make the 3 firefighters white, black and Hispanic. The men in that picture, however, are all white. Now before you get your knickers in a bunch, listen to me. I'm all for racial equality and not for pissin' people off, but let's get one thing straight. You do not rape history for the sake of being politically correct. Yes, i know black firefighters lost their lives in that fire. And many Hispanics perished also. But you know what? A lot of women died in that disaster too. Why not just put a 4th person in the statue and oh, let's make that one a woman. And hey, since we've already ruined the historical accuracy of that poignant moment, let's add a fifth person and make him gay. Then we won't piss anyone off. I honor and respect every single person that died that day. Regardless, one day i will visit this statue and, at the steps of this great tribute to the lost, i will shed the same tears of sorrow. But it breaks my heart that we take this insatiable desire to please people over the edge and shove aside fact for crowd-pleasing fiction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
*phew* I'm done now. See you on Friday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type='html'>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignleft" src="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v3357/13/66/1220240335/n1220240335_1283362_687945.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /&gt;We're in full preparation mode &lt;/strong&gt;now, it seems.  Spent a good portion of the morning cleaning out the van, and was surprised to find that it wasn't that bad.  Just one bag of trash, and it was a small one.  Most of the time, we extract at least a full trash bag worth of goodies from the nooks and crannies hidden away. When you have a five year old, you just can't seem to live a clean life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much still left to be done, I'm afraid.  There's laundry, packing, shopping, and cleaning.  I have to have a clean house house before we leave.  There's no worse feeling than coming home to a dirty house, right?.  No wait, there is a worse feeling; knowing you're coming home to a dirty house, and you still have eight hours left of the drive home.  So, I like to clean before I leave.  Gives me a sense of accomplishment for the whole trip.  And it saves my sanity.  Save it, so I can lose it another day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wife and I are dreading the long drive, though.  SaraJane is at the age where she cannot tolerate being in the car-seat for anything more than a quick journey.  After a minute or two, she starts making a low -pitched, rumbly/achy noise in the back of her throat, which is her first warning that she's about to get really mad.  Another minute, and she starts a bout of yelling, telling you exactly how she feels in 9 month old barky language.  After all of this, and to her immense disappointment, her audible ramblings haven't earned her emancipation from the bonds that hold her, and she cries.  And cries.  And finally, sleeps.  I like when she sleeps.  But that's when you must be very, very quiet.  It makes for a fun car ride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, &lt;/strong&gt;I still have not heard word one from the hospital.  I'm getting antsy.  I've done all I can, I suppose.  It'll start when it starts.  I just want to see what it's like, you know?  I've pretty much decided to move ahead with the CNA program.  After that, I'll start the LPN program at Gateway.  Who knows; with a bit of gentle prodding from the wife, I may even become an RN, and make some decent money again someday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's funny; I never thought I'd change my career.  I thought I'd stay at Cox Communications for years and get some retirement out of it.  I enjoyed it for the most part.  It's when I started driving three hours a day that it began to get old.  Things that never bothered me before became the greatest annoyances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do realize that I have to start working again sometime, if only for my own good.  Some nights, when I have a free moment to think about going into nursing, I get nervous and apprehensive.  I think about what I'll be doing/seeing, and it scares the bongos out of me.  And still other nights, I feel pretty confident and zealous about the whole project.  Any advice from the congregation out there?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh yes, &lt;/strong&gt;and the phone books arrived on our doorstep yesterday.  What a day!  Such an event!  Does my sarcasm come through ok?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took me only a few steps from the front door to get them straight into the recycle bin.  I just don't see the point in having them anymore.  Not for me, that is.  If I need a phone number, address, or recommendation for pizza, I go straight to the iPhone.  Tangent time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The things we mere mortals can do from pocketable telephones now:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Call people&lt;br/&gt;2. Look up anything, anywhere, anytime.  The power of the 'Net.&lt;br/&gt;3.  Read the news&lt;br/&gt;4.  Play video games&lt;br/&gt;5.  Take a picture&lt;br/&gt;6.  Check e-mail&lt;br/&gt;7.  Find out the local temperature/forecast&lt;br/&gt;8.  Check a bank account balance&lt;br/&gt;9.  Pay bills&lt;br/&gt;10.  Listen to music&lt;br/&gt;11.  Watch a movie&lt;br/&gt;12.  Find a movie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And on, and on.  Like living in Star Trek.  I still can't get over it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anywho, back to telephone books.  I understand their importance in quite a few venues.  I know a lot of people must still use them.  And I know they must still generate a lot of cash for ol' Dex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regardless, I can't imagine the vast amount of work and resources that go into a project like the bi-yearly printing of the phone directory.  But most people in my neighborhood have either recycled them, or they're still sitting on the front porch.  I think therefore, that it should be a choice to receive them, no?  I'm not even a landline telephone customer, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Frink" target="_blank"&gt;for cryin' out glavin.  (Mmn hmm, ah hay!)  /Professor Frink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Much to do, much to do. &lt;/strong&gt;Must end, for now.  Thanks for stopping by again!  Much appreciated, for certain.</content>

Silly question.  Because they have a Gap?!  I kid, I kid.  I wanted to show the wife the iPhone.  I think she liked it.  And she could use the keyboard immediately, so she&amp;#39;s already ahead of about 56% of the population.  &lt;p&gt;But that figures, right?  She&amp;#39;s generally more adaptable than I am.  I&amp;#39;m just too stubborn.  &lt;p&gt;Sumner hasn&amp;#39;t woken up since we started for home two hours ago.  This may be one of those nights where he sleeps straight through.  Just as well, cause I&amp;#39;ve got a massive amount of work to do.  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s hoping your night is cheery! &lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

    <title>A stranger</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; font-family: inherit; line-height: 24px;"&gt;A stranger sat next to me during lunch today. His attire was simple; a pair of faded 501's and a plaid shirt. &amp;nbsp;He appeared melancholy at first, but a quick glance in my direction contradicted my observation as he revealed a kind smile and thoughtful eyes behind wire-rim spectacles. Browned leather skin hung loosely from his aged frame, tanned from what appeared to be years of outside labor. &amp;nbsp;He ate no food, instead setting his day planner on the table and examining the contents therein.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; font-family: inherit; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; font-family: inherit; line-height: 24px;"&gt;I considered him for a moment, and the thought crept into my mind that I ought to introduce myself and explain today's HipstaDay project. I grew hesitant as I noticed a hearing aide rising above his left ear. Fear overtook any bravado I had. &amp;nbsp;After all, I have never before approached a stranger to ask for a picture. What if he didn't hear me? &amp;nbsp;What if he misunderstood my intent?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; font-family: inherit; line-height: 24px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; line-height: 24px;"&gt;It was for naught, after all; he quickly gathered his belongings and strode away. I managed to snap this before he left. &amp;nbsp;Bummer, because I actually wanted to know his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: none; line-height: 24px;"&gt;name and what his story was.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lens: John S&lt;br /&gt;Film: Rock BW-11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxVPPvM7Lm1EFPw_9MG92TPe-8nNGSYLdAzmUzUAkiEFLaZ8tnpGjT6PLLyNZS3omKN3sHeV9Pz2si74aLl0bRNst5XIfLzpuRNas7b7KSeyiD7gauujBjuTcUQ5AerJTnKx4m4g/s1600/My+HipstaPrint+920146625-721259.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5728010287690860386" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxVPPvM7Lm1EFPw_9MG92TPe-8nNGSYLdAzmUzUAkiEFLaZ8tnpGjT6PLLyNZS3omKN3sHeV9Pz2si74aLl0bRNst5XIfLzpuRNas7b7KSeyiD7gauujBjuTcUQ5AerJTnKx4m4g/s320/My+HipstaPrint+920146625-721259.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent from my iPhone&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>This sickness</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Day 4 of what seems to be an interminable sickness...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was thinking of putting some large wacky number there, instead of the 4. I was thinking, "that would be good for a laugh, eh?" But then the thought occurred to me that there's nothing funny about being this sick for this long. Nothing! Not a jot nor a tittle. I spent half of the day coughing, the other half aching, and the whole day wondering why i was at work when there was a perfectly acceptable reason to be in bed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Blabbity blah. Where am i going with this entry? The same place as all of my writings, nowhere in particular.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm hungry. Time to eat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;

    <content type='html'>JENNA!   Ok, it took me awhile to figure out that this is your blog.   But I wanted to find you to say thankyou for finding my blog - it was such a nice surprise getting a comment from ya!  And you were born in VERNAL?!   hmph, what are the odds.  Good thing you didn't stay - you might've ended up like the dinosaurs here...
jk, I like Vernal ok. 
Well - your kiddos are absolutely beautiful.  It would be fun to see pics of YOU too! Family photo time.</content>

    <content type='html'>Crunch time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I told you that the entries would thin out over the space of the month, but did anyone believe me? &amp;nbsp;Did you listen? &amp;nbsp;Probably.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My apologies (again) for the delayed entry today. &amp;nbsp;Last night, Wife and I babysat a child of a friend of ours for about four hours while they saw The Return of the King. &amp;nbsp; Before the night was even expired, I felt like a ton of bricks. &amp;nbsp;I couldn't hardly stay awake, so when the time came for the babe to be picked up, I hit the bed like a rock and did not stir until morning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, if I had tried to compose anything last night, it would have been very sloppy and disjointed. &amp;nbsp; So, depending on your point of view, I saved you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this time, I'm waiting for a certain beta to complete downloading so that I can begin the installation process. &amp;nbsp;It was a fairly hefty file, measuring in at just under 250 megabytes. &amp;nbsp;Reminiscing, I wonder what that would have been like on a dial-up connection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Point in fact, it wouldn't. &amp;nbsp;I would not have even tried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Side note: &amp;nbsp;My cat just lost my last fix of Chappy Stick. &amp;nbsp;I saw him do it. &amp;nbsp;He batted that thing right underneath the door of our storage closet. &amp;nbsp;And I'm not going in there to look for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't quite understand his fascination with that petroleum tube, but maybe that's what I should get him for Christmas. &amp;nbsp;However, knowing him, he'd just get disinterested because he couldn't pick them out of my pocket anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh well, you take what you can get. &amp;nbsp;And I have a cat that's addicted to Chap Stick.&lt;br /&gt;

Speaking in terms of days past, there were two brothers. 10 years separated them nearly to the month and day; the sign they shared of Pisces was a bond in both word and temperament. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The older brother was all the younger brother could ask for. Patient and kind, always willing to share time with him. On far too many occasions, the younger would find his way downstairs and into the older's room. He was never once dismissed. Instead, he was welcomed and encouraged to come back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once, the older brother gave the younger a quarter to use for a candy dispenser at Robintino's; the young brother did not forget this. The young brother hopes the older remembers the look on the hiss face. He hopes it contained gratitude. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHS6rrBAwN4ZY5LbdALU6YuSpuFT-GiecvQ2qdEoHH5uMChMHT93NmtzgKeF4nxh20VBSiRN0Xd_a4TjEmHzZdj-AOx2j3H5K0qSHaoHKNr43zhuaSBHgdAX6u6gKWFD8cU2f3/s1600/adamfamily.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHS6rrBAwN4ZY5LbdALU6YuSpuFT-GiecvQ2qdEoHH5uMChMHT93NmtzgKeF4nxh20VBSiRN0Xd_a4TjEmHzZdj-AOx2j3H5K0qSHaoHKNr43zhuaSBHgdAX6u6gKWFD8cU2f3/s320/adamfamily.jpg" width="320" zda="true" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another time, he took the young brother with him to downtown Salt Lake. The young brother remembers this trip fondly, his older brother had a broken leg. They bought magic tricks at a shop at the Crossroads. The young brother was cold at the bus stop, so the older brother gave him his sweater. The young brother was warm, and knew his older brother was likely cold. But the older brother never let on. They also missed the bus. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Countless memories continue; using the older brother's paint, listening to his music, spending time in his room when he had no real business there. He remembers the Sunkist clock on the wall, the replica cars and models in his room. There were pencil drawings on the wall above the door. It smelled of incense and cologne.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The older brother baptized the younger, helped him feel encouraged when times were less than certain, and always made him feel like he was on to something big.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-u78k2FtF118QQzX8IespwACk5MHl3dZlP0oH_vsUReNs0o6NL7JPLwnG6QFN59bJ8Wy6m6B884nz61dOTsQPnZdv7cQxmB4yCaL0wXFj4t0ovkJqngpkRjuJs_zDDvMMx89f/s1600/adam2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="252" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-u78k2FtF118QQzX8IespwACk5MHl3dZlP0oH_vsUReNs0o6NL7JPLwnG6QFN59bJ8Wy6m6B884nz61dOTsQPnZdv7cQxmB4yCaL0wXFj4t0ovkJqngpkRjuJs_zDDvMMx89f/s320/adam2.jpg" width="320" zda="true" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The younger brother remembers the swim meets, concerts (especially singing Goodnight Saigon...killer), football games, date nights, and family dinners. Big events and small, it shows that the young brother was always watching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The younger brother remembers the Vespa. He remembers the trouble he caused when he brought it home, but remembers it only feeling like excitement. This was the vehicle that would carry his hero forth on his journeys. The younger brother pretended his bike was a Vespa. The younger brother pretended he was his older brother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sharing a close birthday, yet being separated by 10 years gave the young brother perspective. It allowed him to see into the future. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy birthday to an older brother who has always exemplified the role he was thrust into, the role that so many fail miserably at, that many are still trying to master. Happy birthday to the older brother that teaches his children to be the best siblings they can be, whether brothers or sisters, older or young.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy birthday to you, Adam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span lang=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

    <title>Jazz game</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Where did I go?&amp;nbsp; Nowhere, really.&amp;nbsp; I've been here, plodding along at a gallant pace.&amp;nbsp; I don't understand what happened; one week, I was writing feverously.&amp;nbsp; The next thing I know, I can't think of a single jot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The hiatus seems to have taken effect on my daily visits, as this site has plummeted from nearly 70 visits to 35 per day.&amp;nbsp; But now, I welcome you back with fresh blogs and toasty media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
During my small stint away from daily updates, the Wife and I had the chance to go to the Jazz-Suns game.&amp;nbsp; We arrived quite a bit earlier that anticipated, and the crowd had not swelled too badly.&amp;nbsp; When we entered the arena, I turned to my wife and asked her if we could try to walk down to the court area.&amp;nbsp; She lovingly obliged, and we made our way down aisle 115 to center court.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
And there they were, the 2003-04 Utah Jazz team.&amp;nbsp; I took pictures, I filmed them a bit on video.&amp;nbsp; The surprising thing is that they didn't seem so big anymore.&amp;nbsp; Sure, a few of them surpass the seven-foot mark, but I'd never had the opportunity to look at an NBA player in the eyes before.&amp;nbsp; And then I realized that they were five years younger and much much richer that I was.&amp;nbsp; Still nothing.&amp;nbsp; I looked at the way they shot the ball.&amp;nbsp; Nope, still human.&amp;nbsp; Finally, a twisting two handed dunk.&amp;nbsp; Ah, ok...there it is.&amp;nbsp; They're the coolest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://s93436477.onlinehome.us/index.php"&gt;&lt;b&gt;your&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;lit.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You should visit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Bizarre birthday ritual</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On a personal note: Happy Birthday, Adam&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; How does number 35 feel?&amp;nbsp; Much like 34 and 33, I presume?&amp;nbsp; Well, congratulations on making it this far.&amp;nbsp; Six kids, a fantastic wife, and a legacy of fine living.&amp;nbsp; I hope this year marks the beginning of many good things for you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hmm... &lt;/b&gt;my brother's birthday is here, which means that mine is fast approaching.&amp;nbsp; Nothing is needed, thank you.&amp;nbsp; The discounted car insurance will be fine enough for me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Many things today&lt;/b&gt;. In fact, I have so many ideas in my head that I'm debating whether or not to save some of these wonders for another day.&amp;nbsp; You've seen my history lately, so you should understand my desire to space things out, right?&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, I tread on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Over the weekend, while visiting my parents house, we broke out the old super 8mm projector.&amp;nbsp; As I have very few baby pictures, my wife really wanted to see what I looked like and this was pretty much the only valid option.&amp;nbsp; It was a little overwhelming at first, when at first I saw the old projector and heard the familiar clicks, I will admit that I was taken back by more than a few years.&amp;nbsp; After wading through 300+ reels and jury-rigging the projector, we managed to view a few of the first moments of my life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And I still don't believe that anyone realizes what an impact that this made on me.&amp;nbsp; I had never seem myself like this before, so small and new.&amp;nbsp; It was me, yet it was not.&amp;nbsp; The small personage in the movies who was writhing around and begging for attention did not bring even the slightest bit of remembrance to mind.&amp;nbsp; We viewed reel after reel and I was amazed ever more with each passing moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
There we were, my entire family, but so much younger.&amp;nbsp; Like the Wonder Years, I tried to give context to the scene before me, but simply couldn't.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I watched with amazement as I watched my life unfold before my eyes.&amp;nbsp; I viewed myself at only a year old, being woken up in my own crib on my birthday.&amp;nbsp; I seemed happy enough.&amp;nbsp; Then, on to my first attempts at walking.&amp;nbsp; My elder brother, who I spoke of earlier, would hold a blue balloon just out of my grasp, and I would clap and try so hard to grab it.&amp;nbsp; I would fall each time, only to be picked up again by my father, smiling and ready to give it a go all over again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I saw myself at eight years old, just before my baptism into the Church.&amp;nbsp; There was a darkened film of my birthday party.&amp;nbsp; The faces only drew brief recognition, as many of their names have long been forgotten.&amp;nbsp; However, one face that I was indeed looking for struck me.&amp;nbsp; My best friend Jimmy, a ghost from the past, was hitting me over the head with my present in some bizarre birthday ritual.&amp;nbsp; In another scene, we were simply talking and laughing about something.&amp;nbsp; It both healed and wounded me so much to see his face again, as I haven't seen him in over seven years.&amp;nbsp; He passed away from leukemia when he was only 17 years old.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
I basically stopped there, because I didn't want emotional overload or because the hour was late, I know not.&amp;nbsp; But it was an experience that I will never forget, and hope to experience again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
Alrighty, that's enough for today.&amp;nbsp; Surely there will be more tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Come back for a free prize.&amp;nbsp; OK, I lied.&amp;nbsp; Come back for more blather.&amp;nbsp; But that's always free.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
And free is a good thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <content type='html'>I so need to redo a site of my own.  But I would probably wind up wanting to code most of the backend stuff myself (instead of being smart and reusing tools already out there).  Oh well.  Nice job on the site, sir!</content>

    <title>Darn it.</title>
    <content type='html'>Darn it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was going to provide you with yet another amusing Sunday picture of Dobby, but apparently, my cell phone provider has black-balled me. &amp;nbsp;Access denied. &amp;nbsp;How humiliating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My wife is in the other room watching "boy TV". &amp;nbsp;It's not any particular show, rather, a type of show. &amp;nbsp;I believe the one she is watching now is called "Maximum Exposure". &amp;nbsp;You know the type. &amp;nbsp;It's basically Cops. &amp;nbsp;Boy TV is anything with stuff caught on tape. &amp;nbsp;Car crashes, hostage situations, people's trousers falling south in public, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, why is my wife watching it? &amp;nbsp;Cause she's cute. &amp;nbsp;Why else?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was quite the uneventful weekend, but I think some of you may have realized what I learned how to do: &amp;nbsp;I made a pop-up advertisement appear on my Web site. &amp;nbsp;Yes, I have joined the unholy ranks of the annoying. &amp;nbsp;Can you blame me? &amp;nbsp;Not many have decided to ask for a free e-mail address, and I simply wanted to ensure that I had my fair warning out there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wife and I decided to alter our choice of grocery stores this time around. &amp;nbsp;We've been stuck on Albertsons for the past couple of months, and truthfully, we haven't been fond of their selection. &amp;nbsp;So, we ventured over to Fry's, and were more than pleased. &amp;nbsp;As my Wife put it, there's enough of any one thing to find at least something you need on sale. &amp;nbsp;And that's the truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what made me happy was they let me bag my own groceries. &amp;nbsp;Ok, ok, they didn't have a bagger and probably wanted me to bag 'em. &amp;nbsp;But when I went to &amp;lt;unnamed store&amp;gt; last time, the bagger actually snarled and informed me that he could lose his job (or some nonsense) if I helped him bag. &amp;nbsp;I thought he was kidding, and continued bagging contently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"No, really. &amp;nbsp;I can get in trouble if you keep doing that." said Unhappy Bagger Boy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oooook. &amp;nbsp;Sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long story short, I like to bag my own groceries. &amp;nbsp;Especially since they put my bleach in the same bag as my eggs. &amp;nbsp;Really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alright. &amp;nbsp;That's done. &amp;nbsp;Off to bed, more later this week. &amp;nbsp;Any suggestions?</content>

    <content type='html'>I have to ask:  How easy did the screen smudge?  That would be one of my biggest concerns (I mean, look what happens to black iPods).  And that keyboard...yeah, I didn't think it was going to work.  Nice to hear that the other stuff works well, though.</content>

    <content type='html'>&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjrwLQ0KEqF0o8UQcSs_Lh_XjWlaICFUIzWc-64YCDn53ZDKF0LnUnuwz-0JtGK3HASuz6dcbbq1yhB5sNBAR5J87gXx5AyGnexGvcFQVDg3yWffAd2XOzjqoy2Y_ipivQ674hEwHkBOVyWMi-J1cJ2M9gSDyVD6T3kF56tqZL_g0yKT4PO0g" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="300" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_7118133409873746962" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjrwLQ0KEqF0o8UQcSs_Lh_XjWlaICFUIzWc-64YCDn53ZDKF0LnUnuwz-0JtGK3HASuz6dcbbq1yhB5sNBAR5J87gXx5AyGnexGvcFQVDg3yWffAd2XOzjqoy2Y_ipivQ674hEwHkBOVyWMi-J1cJ2M9gSDyVD6T3kF56tqZL_g0yKT4PO0g=w400-h300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Having driven the new car for a few days now, I've gathered a few thoughts about the differences between my previous Tesla Model 3 and this new Chevy Bolt. &amp;nbsp;Fun fact: I haven't test driven the last two cars I purchased. &amp;nbsp;That is an absurd statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;The Tesla that I owned previously was a 2019 model year, "Standard Range Plus" version with a maximum of 240 miles of range. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;My new car is a 2022 Chevy (I refuse to type "Chevrolet", tho I just did...) Bolt EV 2LT. &amp;nbsp;Maximum range: 259 miles. &amp;nbsp;On paper, that doesn't seem like much of a difference. But my goodness, in real world driving comparisons, it seems night and day. &amp;nbsp;My commute to work is a healthy 31 miles each way, and I was always conscious of what my battery started and ended at. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;For example, any given weekday morning, I would wake up with ~185 miles of range on my Model 3 (I would charge to 90% only). &amp;nbsp;Given maths, one would assume that I arrive at work with around 154 miles of range left. &amp;nbsp;More often than not, however, my range would be in the 140s. &amp;nbsp;On occasion, my gauge would correct itself and say I had 150 or 160, but that was rare and only really on 70º mornings, when the battery was at it's nominal temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Now, I realize I only have a few days of real-world usage, but I've only had to charge my car once in the 4 days I have had it. &amp;nbsp;This morning in particular, I started my drive with 226 miles of range (again, charging to 90% because no one can seemingly come to a consensus online about charging best practices) and ended my drive with 212 miles remaining. &amp;nbsp;Now, I have some observations about this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Driving habits:&lt;/b&gt; I would drive my Tesla hard. &amp;nbsp;I never used "Chill mode". &amp;nbsp;It was always balls to the wall, bat outta hell style driving. &amp;nbsp;This is my fault. &amp;nbsp;But no one could challenge me on the road. &amp;nbsp;Each launch at a green light would cost me dearly. &amp;nbsp;The Bolt? She has not yet entered "Sport Mode", which basically means I am running this car in Chill mode 100% of the time. &amp;nbsp;It's served to calm me down. &amp;nbsp;Plus, it's a new car, so I am babying her. &amp;nbsp;I haven't taken Max above 75mph. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall efficiency: &lt;/b&gt;This is a smaller car. &amp;nbsp;It's obvious just by looking at it in the garage. I am simply not launching a longer, heavier car around the freeways. (update: I am full of garbage. &amp;nbsp;The weights are nearly the same: 3552 lbs vs 3289 lbs)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Regardless, I am seeing some huge advantages with this newer EV. &amp;nbsp;Anecdotal statements from subredditors say that Tesla's range estimation algorithm is messy and unpredictable. &amp;nbsp;Sure seems that way, to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;So, what do I like about the Bolt more than my previous Model 3? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ride height. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;I never thought this would be me. &amp;nbsp;But it's easy to get in/out. &amp;nbsp;I see more of the road around me. &amp;nbsp;It's a nice feeling, and it gives me great visibility. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical buttons. &lt;/b&gt;Sorry, but swiping on a screen, in retrospect, was inefficient at best and dangerous at worst. &amp;nbsp;I want to turn down the AC? Tap the AC button, miss the touch point, fix what I touched, get the right touch point, adjust the AC slider, oops...too high, adjust down...etc. &amp;nbsp;Now, I reach over and push a button up and down. &amp;nbsp;Magical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;That A/C. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of the A/C, Chevy knows how to cool a car down. &amp;nbsp;While I don't have rear air, it hardly matters. &amp;nbsp;That air is chilly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sound system. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Bolt came with a 7 speaker Bose system that fairly trounces the sound from the Tesla.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quieter ride.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;Some of this can be chalked up to the fact that I replaced my rear tires in the Tesla with cheaper, louder tires. &amp;nbsp;But the cabin in the Bolt feels quieter to me, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wireless CarPlay. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Seriously, I had wired CarPlay in my 2016 Hyundai, and I missed it each and every day. &amp;nbsp;Now I can use Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, Apple Music, Spotify...whatever I want. &amp;nbsp;It's my choice, and it's divine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No glass roof. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Looks great, in theory...but as the driver? You never see it. &amp;nbsp;Only your passengers see it. &amp;nbsp;And I live in AZ. &amp;nbsp;It's HOT. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;360º backup (HD Surround Vision). &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;So nice to see everything around me as I park. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and 25% of the time, my backup camera in the Tesla would fail to respond. &amp;nbsp;So that was fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Regen Paddle. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;On my Bolt's steering wheel, there's a paddle on the left side. &amp;nbsp;Pull it, and it doubles the regenerative properties of the permanent magnet motor. &amp;nbsp;I already use one-peddle driving, having gotten used to it in my Tesla. &amp;nbsp;But this regen paddle basically ensures that I may never need to use my brakes, unless in an emergency. &amp;nbsp;And this can only help increase my range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;REAL SiriusXM radio. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yep, I am hooked on the stuff. &amp;nbsp;I have had to use the app for the past 3 years. &amp;nbsp;It wasn't a huge deal, but it did require me to launch it from my phone before I could drive away and listen to it. &amp;nbsp;I also had to reach for my phone to change stations. &amp;nbsp;But now, I have the full experience back. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and it's cheaper. &amp;nbsp;$5.99/month vs $8.99.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are quite a few other things I really like, but I think this entry is getting boring. So, how about what I don't like?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It really is smaller. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;The center console is narrow, and only one arm really belongs on it at any given time. &amp;nbsp;My rear seat passengers better be children, and small ones at that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No AutoPilot. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Nope. &amp;nbsp;No auto steer, none of it. &amp;nbsp;I have lane keep assist, but that is a poor man's implementation of the most advanced level 2 self driving technology known to man. &amp;nbsp;I miss it. &amp;nbsp;I will forever miss it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;SuperCharger network.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;For now, I am forbidden the use of Tesla's expansive network of fast charging stations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/07/tesla-preparing-open-superchargers-non-tesla-evs-us-year/" target="_blank"&gt;But that could change, by year's end.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The "Cool factor". &lt;/b&gt;It's just not a Tesla. &amp;nbsp;It's a Chevy. &amp;nbsp;No one is gonna stop me at the drive through and say, "Cool car, man".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two screens instead of one.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;This one completely surprised me. &amp;nbsp;But it has been a wee bit disorienting going back to having my speed, battery charge, etc directly in front of me again. &amp;nbsp;So I am now looking back and forth between two screens, instead of the one massive screen in the Tesla. &amp;nbsp;I am really confident that I will get over this pretty quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The app experience. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tesla's app was superbly designed and showed me everything I needed. &amp;nbsp;And it was usually quick to refresh. &amp;nbsp;But the MyChevrolet app is slow, inefficient, and doesn't show me critical information. &amp;nbsp;Are my doors locked? &amp;nbsp;Dunno. &amp;nbsp;Sure, I can lock them. &amp;nbsp;But shouldn't you show me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phone as a key. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;This one hurts. &amp;nbsp;I never carried around a key fob in the last 3 years. &amp;nbsp;I walk up to my car, it's unlocked. &amp;nbsp;I walk away, it locks. &amp;nbsp;I miss this dearly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;That blinding, raw speed. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;I may turn on Sport Mode someday and negate this one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The frunk.&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;That extra space really came in handy, especially when bringing home pizza for the kids!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rear A/C. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;See above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the end, the pros outweigh the cons. &amp;nbsp;She's still an EV, so that makes it a win for me. &amp;nbsp;How about y'all? &amp;nbsp;Any questions for me about my experience in switching away from a Tesla?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Daddy?  I'va shoe!</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Another week is &lt;/b&gt;upon us.&amp;nbsp; Well, not for me, not yet at least.&amp;nbsp; It's still Sunday night as I type this.&amp;nbsp; My friend and I just spent a good couple of hours playing Lufia II for the Super Nintendo.&amp;nbsp; Lufia is an old RPG that we used to play for hours and hours when we were still in high school.&amp;nbsp; Ah, good times.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's the great thing about the Super Nintendo.&amp;nbsp; The games just don't seem to get old; they really retain their replay value.&amp;nbsp; As a side note to this topic, the wife and I had been looking for a used Wheel of Fortune game for a while now.&amp;nbsp; In our weekend pursuits, we happened across an extremely cheap copy of the game for the Nintendo 64, the successor to the aforementioned Super Nintendo.&amp;nbsp; We decided to purchase it, and upon playing it at home, only got one game out of it before we turned it off.&amp;nbsp; It just looked so dated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The wife and child are away at the moment, visiting her mom and dad in Mesa.&amp;nbsp; Since she has observations down there on Mondays anyway, she decided to spend the night there instead of waking up at the crack of dawn.&amp;nbsp; Smart lass.&amp;nbsp; But now, the house is empty and quiet, and I don't feel much like sleeping.&amp;nbsp; So, I update.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On Saturday, &lt;/b&gt;we celebrated two birthdays.&amp;nbsp; My mother turned X years on the 18th, so happy birthday to her, indeed.&amp;nbsp; I found her two bags of lemons on the side of the road, and delivered them personally.&amp;nbsp; No, I lied; the wife found them.&amp;nbsp; But I delivered them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Was that all I gave her, you ask?&amp;nbsp; Why no, we also purchased the game SceneIt! for her.&amp;nbsp; My wife said that she mentioned wanting it once upon a time, and she did seem pretty excited to receive it.&amp;nbsp; Oh, and we got her a small box of chocolates that I thought were Jordan almonds.&amp;nbsp; Darn packaging trickery.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It was also Jenna's grandpa's 80th birthday.&amp;nbsp; Good on him for it.&amp;nbsp; The entire family spent the afternoon at a park near our house, wind and all.&amp;nbsp; I swear that man doesn't seem 80 years old to me.&amp;nbsp; He was running around, chasing his great-grandchildren around that park like he was 30 years younger.&amp;nbsp; I can only hope to be able to move as fast at that age.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Most of the family played a game of softball to round out the festivities, myself included.&amp;nbsp; During a "crucial" point in the game, my brother-in-law had to run to home plate, so I covered second in his stead.&amp;nbsp; Headed directly for me was my wife's cousin, by no means a small person, and he creamed me.&amp;nbsp; Completely bowled me over.&amp;nbsp; My hip still hurts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But no matter.&amp;nbsp; It was fun nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; Sunday was very uneventful, Sumner and I had to return home early on during church time because he wasn't having any part of it.&amp;nbsp; His finger was stuck in his mouth the entire car-ride home, so I reckon he might have been teething.&amp;nbsp; Or he might just want me to have believed so.&amp;nbsp; Trust me, the little kid is getting smarter each day, so I put nothing past him at this point.&amp;nbsp; For crying out loud, we just had our first telephone conversation today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"Hello?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"Daddy?&amp;nbsp; I'va shoe!'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"You have a shoe?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"Yah! A shoe!&amp;nbsp; Hi?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"Hello, Sumner!&amp;nbsp; I love you!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;"Love you, Daddy.&amp;nbsp; Bye!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's pert much how it was hammered out.&amp;nbsp; He turns two in about three weeks.&amp;nbsp; I won't cliché this blog by saying that the time is going by too fast, but dangit if it is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'd imagine &lt;/b&gt;this is long enough for a Monday entry.&amp;nbsp; Like me, I'm sure you all have a load of work/school/other to catch up on, so enjoy it, and certainly enjoy your entire week.&amp;nbsp; I'll be back tomorrow with more disreputable drivel.&amp;nbsp; Cheers!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;P.S. @ 11:34pm&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;I'd like to know who's visiting lately. If you've a moment, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:rd@outsidetheworld.com"&gt;drop me a line.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yet another P.S. at 12:49am&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;The &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/news.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section of OTW has just been added!&amp;nbsp; We'll see how this works out.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind, I don't select the news, I just pass it on.&amp;nbsp; So when weird things get on there, don't tell me.&amp;nbsp; Tell the A.P.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Sick and Star Wars</title>
    <content type='html'>Today: Sick and Star Wars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we go! &amp;nbsp;It's right on time. &amp;nbsp;I feel myself coming down with something, and oh, look...it's one day before Thanksgiving. &amp;nbsp;This means that I get to spend my Turkey Day feeling scratchy and stuffy again. &amp;nbsp;I think this makes eight years in a row, solid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, maybe I'm overreacting. I started to feel the customary twinge in the throat when I woke up this morning, and by afternoon, my head was pounding four-alarm style. &amp;nbsp; I simply have that whole-bodied yuckiness that leads to a cold...and by the looks of people around me at work, this cold season ain't pretty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enough of that. &amp;nbsp;I just finished watching Star Wars: &amp;nbsp;Clone Wars. &amp;nbsp;For those not yet introduced to this title, it is a series of five minute episodes, which detail the events between Episode two and three.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's a marvelous display of animation. &amp;nbsp;From the beginning of the series, straight till the end, you can view the immense galaxy of Star Wars the way that it was meant to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most notably, in the final (for now) episode, you find out exactly why Anakin Skywalker is described as a "brilliant pilot". &amp;nbsp;He swoops and dodges enemy fighters, constructs immensely intricate maneuvers, and brings down entire enemy strong holds with his trained mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sadly, they have taken down the ability to view past episodes from their Web site, but rest assured that they will be back up in Spring of 2004, which is also when the final ten episodes will air on the Cartoon Network.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I'm going to fight this cold off with a bit of bed rest. &amp;nbsp;Until next time, keep checking back...I sense new changes afoot...</content>

I no longer really look for things to shoot. I only shot this because I glanced up for a moment. &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s too blasted hot to go hunting for shots outside. And inside?

And thanks to the magic of non-destructive edits, I was able to turn back the hands of time by six years and uncover the virgin, unedited picture with a few taps of my finger. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hipstamatic doesn't always do what I wish it would. &amp;nbsp;But that's part of the appeal, in a way. &amp;nbsp;Harkening back to the days of disposable point and shoots, when one would never know what result would come until the day of development, Hipstamatic brings a little bit of risk back into digital photography.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I digress; such is no longer the case. &amp;nbsp;I remember reading years ago when the developers added non-destructive edits, but I believe I only scoffed when I saw that news. &amp;nbsp;I probably figured it would tarnish what I believed to be a perfect app.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I've grown up a bit, and today's photo brings me a bit of excitement. &amp;nbsp;Because buried within the 27,000+ photos in my library is the possibility of a few more gems worth re-editing. &amp;nbsp;And that will tide me over quite well until I can get back out on the road and capture a few new shots.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It even outshines the solid feel of my 5.5g iPod.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I placed a few test calls and was impressed by the sound quality, but not overly so.  The volume was a bit low.  I can definitely get my Treo louder.  &lt;p&gt;EDGE speeds were actually functional.  Whatever unofficial upgrades they made to the network speed during the past week will definitely pay off, though we&amp;#39;ll see how that pays off as more customers activate their devices.&lt;p&gt;The most impressive aspect of the iPhone and the only thing to trump my Treo was the new touchscreen. Unlike most other smart phone&amp;#39;s screens, this one is made of glass and you can just feel the technology behind it.  I never had to push very hard to get it to respond.&lt;p&gt;And yes, they virtual &amp;quot;keyboard&amp;quot; was terrible.  I&amp;#39;ve written this entire post from my Treo with very few errors or corrections.  The simple text message I sent from the iPhone took way too long.&lt;p&gt;Overall, I like it though.  It&amp;#39;s a good device, and I hope it comes to Sprint someday so that my wife can get it.&lt;p&gt;Excellent...&lt;p&gt;Posted wirelessly!</content>

My sweet wife knows my memory just isn't what it used to be. She'll often speak of things in our past with color and description when all I can muster is a vague remembrance or hint. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nevertheless, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of memories in this gray matter of mine that are indelibly etched because they're associated with that sweet, perfect girl. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And on this, her 27th birthday, I want to mark the day with just a few of those memories, in no particular order. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.  New York City. Landing in the city of my mission meant something entirely different to me when she was by my side. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2.  Walking along the beach on our honeymoon, after we took public transportation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3.  Baby #1. Walking around the hospital with her dressed in a yellow robe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. I remember when she got her job at Ottawa. She didn't even need an interview. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5. I used to have a scooter, and it was pouring rain. She picked me up from work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6. Our first visit to Lake Arrowhead. It was so fun to see where she visited when she was little. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7. Our engagement pictures with her best friend. Her friend took them with a disposable camera and developed them in black and white. They were great. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8. A kiss on the cheek under the basketball hoop on New Year's Eve. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9. Our wedding day. She looked like a barbie doll and I still don't know how I'm so lucky. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10. Rock climbing before we were married. In fact, we should go back. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11. Disneyland. I think every trip was amazing. We tend to forget the outside world when we're there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
12. Bagel date. Enough said. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
13. Baby # 2. She was so tough and decided that natural was the way to go from there on out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
14. David Gray concert. I'd never really sung in front of her until that night. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
15. Lagoon!  She didn't even get to go on a ride because our first baby was so young. But she loved it there, and it was fun to have her with me. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
16. A surprise visit to Snowbird. I arranged to have our son watched by my sister and drove up the mountain after lunch at Olive Garden. I told her it was just a quick trip but surprised her when I checked into the same room we had for our honeymoon in Utah. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
17. Driving home from Utah when I decided I needed Benadryl. Poor thing drove home the whole way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
18. Billy Joel concert. We originally had expensive tickets to see his show, when he got into a car accident and went into rehab. The show was cancelled. A year later, he came back, but we had only enough money for the crappiest seats there. It was still a great show, because she was there. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
19. Proposing to her. Still glad she said yes, yes, yes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
20. Baby # 3. It was such a blur!  But my goodness, she was tough. No meds, 10 minute labor. And then there were five of us. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
21. Moving into our first apartment. Building new furniture, hanging pictures, decorating for Christmas, we loved that little 725 square foot apartment. She cried when we moved out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
22. OT school. 4am study sessions, cadaver labs, rotations, and finals. Summa Cum Laude. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
23. One day shortly after our first was born, Jenna was hit in a parking lot. She called me, crying. It was her first and only accident  Ever since then, my worry rises when she calls me crying!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
24. Her first marathon. 26.2 miles and a broken foot. She smiled when she crossed the finish line. I offered to get the car and pick her up, but she wanted to walk. Another mile. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
25. Our San Diego trip. It was supposed to be the cabin, but we drove south instead and used priceline everyday. Actually one of my favorite memories. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
26. Every walk we've ever been on. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
27. Before our first was born, she watched every Star Trek movie with me. Every. Single. One. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, just a few of those wonderful memories.  I hope I didn't miss anything major.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love this girl with all my heart.</content>

    <title>Sigh</title>
    <content type='html'>A little bit of extra time at work today…so….&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things have been slow. Overall, life seems to be pacing itself. Getting ready for the long haul of winter…except that maybe life doesn’t realize I live in Arizona, and the winter here may not come&lt;br /&gt;
at all. The good thing is that I like autumn time in the southwest… the air has a certain flavor in it that tells you the seasons have changed. You have to look for the subtleties of nature. Sure, the trees look the same and temperature hasn’t dropped but a few degrees in the daytime, but the golf courses are all yellowed in anticipation for the winter rye and the nights are not so oppressive anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In comparison, last year I still worked in the Canyon at this time. I had the changing leaves, the chilly temperatures at nighttime and the assertion that the next rainstorm may leave us with a blanket of pure white. But I don’t mind it now; anybody who lives here knows that life in Arizona begins in October.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, now im taking off for Utah, and it should be a great trip. My sister just had her second...little Hadley Rebecca. When i return from the Wasatch front i should have plenty of pictures of the lass which of course, i will post as soon as possible. I can't wait to see the mountains again....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Mountains, Gandolf! I want to see mountains!"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, someone once said,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"I’m not saying the blogs I read are good because they’re trivial. They’re not. But most good blogs I read display no sense of limitation; they’re not constrained by the need to be Important every time they approach the mike, so they develop a sense of personality much quicker than a newspaper columnist ever can. In 94 out of 100 cases this means the work is crap, but in the 6 out 100 it means you get the sort of column newspapers will never run. Or could. Or should.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm still trying to decide where I'm at now? Have a great week! Sorry for the weak Wedge...I'll make it up in Pine Cones.</content>

    <title>Lazy Sundays</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I know I've said it before, but I'm at liberty to say it again:&amp;nbsp; Lazy Sundays are nice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZNRC0EazAht9fyaZ1otExzEJWhu3c9BTDs5P1DZ1c5PCKt8Wh3CszdJ82bBnETpju8hksf4LqR4LuUr1CosTnTh4IYK7TL41_xdf2xtUrOt9MxwHGaxDW4tk3nbBId8esqLr-/s1600/dobby.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZNRC0EazAht9fyaZ1otExzEJWhu3c9BTDs5P1DZ1c5PCKt8Wh3CszdJ82bBnETpju8hksf4LqR4LuUr1CosTnTh4IYK7TL41_xdf2xtUrOt9MxwHGaxDW4tk3nbBId8esqLr-/s1600/dobby.jpg" height="258" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
It may be silly to post cat pictures as much as I do, but there simply the best representations of feelings of relaxation.&amp;nbsp; Not since my father has anyone been able to sleep so professionally.&amp;nbsp; And I mean that with the utmost respect, of course.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I had to work on Saturday, so that blew most of the weekend plans.&amp;nbsp; I had one specific idea that could have surprised my wife, but now, that'll have to wait until next weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New Pictures.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;You may wish to visit the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/photography.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page of this site, for there you'll find the best in photographic excellence.&amp;nbsp; Ironic though, they aren't mine.&amp;nbsp; I receive a digital camera for Christmas, and post-holiday, the only things I have to grant are my brother's capturings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Nonetheless, they're absolutely beautiful works, and I wanted my brother to be able to post them online.&amp;nbsp; He and his family of eight live in Spring City, Utah, and I honestly believe that it's one of the most serene places I've visited. (I haven't been very far)&amp;nbsp; It snowed several inches over the weekend in this little town of 700.&amp;nbsp; The entire vista is encompassed in brilliant white spectacle.&amp;nbsp; I had my brother take his digi-cam out into the open and give me a look.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was just discussing with him how odd it was that he could have children in this small town and the population actually increases noticeably.&amp;nbsp; I believe he described it as anachronistic, and that it is.&amp;nbsp; I have never experienced life as he does.&amp;nbsp; In many ways, I wish I could.&amp;nbsp; There are more people in my apartment complex than there are in his town.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's all that I have for today, but only because I'm distracted.&amp;nbsp; Come back tomorrow if you feel so inclined.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>At lunch</title>
    <content type='html'>Sitting here, minding my own business.  Simply reading news articles on my iPad, when I notice two "gentlemen" laughing in my general direction. I notice a windows based net book on their table. I shoot them a look that quite possibly corrupted their registry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They leave without giving me another look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I smile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have no issues with other peoples' technology choices. Really, I don't. But give me a break. Don't knock it till you try it.</content>

    <title>Disobedience</title>
    <content type='html'>&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Air conditioner status: Continued disobedience toward functionality.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I'm also debating whether to stack my blogs from bottom to top, or vice versa. Such is what I'm trying to think about right now as I type. Surprisingly, i found it much tougher to get back into my daily blogging now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I used to have a free mind when I wrote, I would extend myself into my blogs on a nightly basis. I really wanted something to be proud of; I wanted something that I could look back upon and be able to identify my exact state of mind at any one time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lileks.com/"&gt;James Lileks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has a site that I strive to provide. Alas, I do not yet have the quirky style that that man possesses...I do not yet have the ability to observe the daily lives of individuals and extrapolate the tiniest details and turn them into cohesive literature.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But that man does, and soon, so soon, i wish to also.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Anyway, sorry about the site, it's still under construction on a daily basis. Tonight, Wife and I went to our friend's house for a birthday party. Complete family and friends were there, and it was nice to be invited to that setting. Amidst the raucous laughter and crying baby, I could feel the tight knit bonds that held my friend's family together.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's the same feeling I get when I'm around my Wife. And quite frankly, that just makes me that much more excited for Baby. (until I gain knowledge on the gender of the child, they will be called by the name of "Baby")&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p2"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
So, that's it for now, much more later. Anybody need a Web site?&lt;/div&gt;

Oh, but I do.&amp;nbsp; For any who have visited this page by manner of my brother's linkage, he's probably referring to the entry from the 12th, located below.&amp;nbsp; That was the entry with the humor and such.&lt;/div&gt;

I hate to bore you with more details, the work week has my mind bogged down like an overburdened freight truck.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow:&amp;nbsp; Basketball.&amp;nbsp; See you then.&lt;/div&gt;

I discovered my ability to negotiate the trails has been slightly diminished. After a few rough patches, I decided to take a break and shoot what I saw. &lt;p&gt;The desert really is beautiful in the spring. &lt;p&gt;Lens: Tejas&lt;br&gt;Film: Ina&amp;#39;s 1935</content>

    <title>New apartment</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The best news?&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; I have a window with a near perfect view of the sunset.&amp;nbsp; From the sky's velvet canopy, light cascades toward the horizon in a stunning gradient of blue and white.&amp;nbsp; The area just above the surrounding buildings is light gray, and the clouds have no texture.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's not perfect, but I'm going to love living here.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The move went as I'd anticipated, with a few bumps along the way.&amp;nbsp; With the help of a few friends and family members, we were able to complete the transition in about seven hours.&amp;nbsp; I'm still recouping from the weekend.&amp;nbsp; Every portion of my body aches.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
The new place is just big enough for us.&amp;nbsp; There is plenty of open carpet space to sprawl out on, and all of our furniture fits without cramping.&amp;nbsp; The most noticeable benefit is that the computer is no longer in the dining room.&amp;nbsp; What a boon, says I.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
But the weekend went by too fast.&amp;nbsp; I hardly remember anything other than moving, and I want some more time to enjoy the apartment with my wife.&amp;nbsp; Poor thing, she hasn't even been home, really.&amp;nbsp; Right after the move, she went to work.&amp;nbsp; She hasn't slept in days, it seems.&amp;nbsp; But she's pretty tough, and she'll get to sleep in tomorrow for sure.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
That's it.&amp;nbsp; The sun has set, thus placing its darkening influence over my mind.&amp;nbsp; Best to all, and may I add a thank you to all of the frequent visitors.&amp;nbsp; Send an &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/contactus.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;e-mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, eh?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>TiVo</title>
    <content type='html'>A little late in the day, but still, it's December 5th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And since this is probably going to be archived fairly soon, I'd imagine that this particular entry won't be widely read by everyone. &amp;nbsp;So, I suppose that I can write whatever I want, and no one will care!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a busy week. &amp;nbsp;Five days, completely non-stop. &amp;nbsp;From work, to fixing my friend's computers, I don't remember one moment when I wasn't doing something, somewhere. &amp;nbsp;I'm looking forward to tomorrow with great anticipation, as I have absolutely nothing on the agenda.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, time to spare. &amp;nbsp;Maybe a little bit of it will be spent on the Web site, maybe a little on catching up on a little TiVo'd television, probably a little shopping, and a whole lotta nothin'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope that the weekend greets all of you in the same regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If any of you haven't noticed, there's a new page link on this site. &amp;nbsp;It's called Flotsam, and it's where everything that I've already retired is going to wash up. &amp;nbsp;From old graphics to old outdated Web pages, you'll find it in there. &amp;nbsp;For those who have visited this site frequently, you may recognize a few pictures. &amp;nbsp;Warning: &amp;nbsp;Most of the links in those pages are very, very defunct. &amp;nbsp;You'll soon meet Mr. 404 if you wade around those pages for very long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other news: &amp;nbsp;My Wife's second ultrasound is next Tuesday. &amp;nbsp;Mark your calendars, because there will be quite an entry that day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a great weekend! &amp;nbsp;May yours last as long as mine.</content>

Fine. &amp;nbsp;Reap your rewards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Thankfully, we made it back in one piece. &amp;nbsp;And it looked like the lion's share of our adjacent travelers did, as well. &amp;nbsp;Those who slid off the road were, at best, mildly inconvenienced. &amp;nbsp;For the worst, they might have had to catch a ride back into town. &amp;nbsp;We did see one poor fellow who careened off the 17 and tore his entire bumper off. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mobile-photo"&gt;Glad to be back in the Valley of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I care</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So was that it?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Was that my proverbial moment in the sun?&amp;nbsp; A brief entrance into the realm of super-sites, with visitor averages in the hundreds?&amp;nbsp; Maybe.&amp;nbsp; But at least some people looked around.&amp;nbsp; That's always reassuring.&amp;nbsp; I didn't want to appear as some sort of sell-out, mind you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Oh fine.&amp;nbsp; If you're really looking for a spong monkey, they aren't here anymore.&amp;nbsp; They left.&amp;nbsp; But you're welcome to stay.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
For those of you who may be new to this site, welcome.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you care to look around, be my guest; however, I never guarantee that this site is A. Coherent and B. Enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; Although I've been told in times past that it is, indeed, both.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Outside the World is my expression to the world.&amp;nbsp; It's a blog, and it's updated daily, so visit frequently.&amp;nbsp; I don't advertise my writings with cute unsubstantiated statements, as they all make me wretch.&amp;nbsp; But hopefully, with the passing of time, this blog will garner the numbers to justify my emotion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Past entries will be found in the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/archive.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Archives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I recommend that you try that first, because everything else won't make sense without it.&amp;nbsp; If you go to the &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/personal.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page, you will find other assorted hoo-hah material, such as pictures and writings.&amp;nbsp; If you really feel brave, get a &lt;a href="http://outsidetheworld.com/archives/OldPages/mail.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;free e-mail address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Ah, come on.&amp;nbsp; Don't I have the right to exhibit my own wares?&amp;nbsp; Fine.&amp;nbsp; If you're ever in the mood for some truly excellent writing, rather than mangled consonant-mash, you could always try my &lt;a href="http://www.bloggenpucky.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;brother's site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He likes natural soap.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On to other things&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I need some new music, but I lost my registration key.&amp;nbsp; As I installed my copy of Acid 4.0, a small thought kept jumping up in my mind, demanding I give it attention.&amp;nbsp; A slight itch, reminding me that this product requires registration before use.&amp;nbsp; Where had I put this code?&amp;nbsp; Doesn't matter, I'll just zip right through it and hopefully it'll let me use the program that I rightfully own.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
It's funny how we humans believe our own lies, even after only 30 seconds of false encouragement.&amp;nbsp; By the time the program had finished installing, I had built myself up for success.&amp;nbsp; I expected to be able to use this program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&amp;lt;double click&amp;gt; &lt;span class="s3"&gt;Hi! Registration code, please?&amp;nbsp; Because we own you and not vice versa?&lt;/span&gt; (yes I'm thinking and therefore writing in sentence fragments.&amp;nbsp; I care.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I was so vehemently disappointed.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.&amp;nbsp; Another month, and I'll be ready to give them a call and voice my opinion.&amp;nbsp; Or I'll just call and act really nice and hope they give me a new key.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ho, boy&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It's been a dry day, for sure.&amp;nbsp; Any evidence of this is apparent in the above paragraphs.&amp;nbsp; Promises for more articulate writing tomorrow, eh?&amp;nbsp; Good day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Never let go</title>
    <content type='html'>







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="td1" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One visit after another&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Sumner is quite the popular boy.&amp;nbsp; From proud grandparents to curious neighbors, this little baby has caused an increase in visits for our family, indeed.&amp;nbsp; He's a genuinely serene child, and when I hold him in my arms and look at him, I feel nothing but love for him.&amp;nbsp; It's shocking how easily they grab a hold of your heart strings.&amp;nbsp; I just hope that he never lets go.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
Mommy is still doing wonderful, if not slightly euphoric.&amp;nbsp; The most beautiful thing to watch is both of them sleeping in bed, his little head somewhat crooked in her arm.&amp;nbsp; Earlier this morning, we were cleaning out all of our bags from the hospital when she told me that she really enjoyed her stay there.&amp;nbsp; At first, I was incredulous, but after pondering the entire experience, I had to agree.&amp;nbsp; From the moment we got to the hospital, we completely felt comfortable and cared for.&amp;nbsp; The delivery, and every moment leading up to it, was spent together and in total confidence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
I don't know how common it is for couples to have this great of an experience during delivery, but I do know that I am and forever will be grateful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="p1"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A couple of weeks off&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As my job offers paternal leave, I will be off for the next couple of weeks to be with my family.&amp;nbsp; That means that I should have plenty of time to regularly update this forsaken blog and Web site.&amp;nbsp; Friendly contact of encouragement is recommended, of course.&amp;nbsp; And as always, we welcome any visits or calls.&amp;nbsp; The door is always open.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
